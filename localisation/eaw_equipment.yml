Though current ideas for new, genuinely amphibious tank designs have hit a dead end, our engineers are considering converting heavier vehicles instead. Often, the tank does not need to swim or wade great distances, so we should focus on making it capable of swimming that short distance to keep its combat capabilities."

### МАГІЧНЕ ПІХОТНЕ СПОРЯДЖЕННЯ ###
 magical_equipment: "Магічне піхотне спорядження"
 magical_equipment_short: "Магічне спор."
 magical_equipment_desc:0 "Magic equipment is largely identical to regular equipment, with one exception: the weapon uses crystal-based ammunition and fires deadly spells instead of kinetic projectiles."

 magical_equipment_1: "Магічні гвинтівки" # рушниці?
 magical_equipment_1_short: "Магічні гвинтівки"
 magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "Magic is inherent to most sapient life, but not everyone can harness it as a weapon. Innovative designs in firearms have led to the invention of the magic rifle, a gun that uses specially imbued crystal-based cartridges to launch devastating spells against enemies. However, sustained fire makes the rifle prone to malfunctions due to the finicky nature of magic crystals. Despite its questionable reliability, the field of magic firearms is nascent and is bound to improve on these early designs."
 magical_equipment_2: "Магічні автоматичні гвинтівки"
 magical_equipment_2_short: "Магічні авто. гвинтівки"
 magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "Attempts to improve the firing rate of magic firearms displayed in full force the challenges presented in using crystal-based ammunition. Self-loading magic firearms require a far larger and heavier firing mechanism than usual, making a portable magic semi-automatic rifle unwieldy. However, this line of research has produced a viable light machine gun equivalent. Despite their propensity to misfire, the suppressive and destructive firepower makes these automatic magic rifles deadly weapons."
 magical_equipment_3: "Магічний легкий кулемет"
 magical_equipment_3_short: "Магічний ЛК"
 magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "Breakthroughs in spell imbuements lighten the cartridges used in magic firearms, allowing a streamlining of the firing mechanism of previous designs. The new design, in turn, reduces the overall weight of the weapon, turning previous automatic magic rifles into true light machine guns. Specialised ammunition also changes the spell launched at enemy targets, making for a more effective magic LMG for most situations."
 magical_equipment_4: "Сучасні магічні гвинтівки"
 magical_equipment_4_short: "Суч. магічні гвинтівки"
 magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "Continued refinements in magic firearms design have finally yielded a set of practical select-fire rifles that can chamber crystal cartridges. In order to address the propensity of magic firearms suffering catastrophic failures, the overall fire rate is considerably lower than that of conventional assault rifles. However, these modern magic rifles are lightweight enough to be used on the move and are as effective as the regular service rifle."

#SIC custom EaW tech and unit loc
 SIC_knights:0 "Rediarios"
 SIC_knights_desc:0 "Since the age of the ancient Karthin Empire, the griffons of Sicameon have prefered the Retiarii, fast and nimble fighters who ensnare their sword and shield wielding opponents with net and trident, rather than the feudalist symbol that is the Knight. Styled as the Rediarios in modern times, they trade their fishing fork and snare for the rifle, shovel, and camouflage net, vigilantly ready to quickly confront the enemy and stubbornly hold the line, figuratively ensnaring them with tricks, traps, and trenches and slaying those bogged down opponents with gunfire."
 SIC_tech_knights:0 "Retiarii Division I"
 SIC_tech_knights_desc:0 "Perhaps not known the world round but certainly feared by the knights of imperial Griffonia for their speed and cunning, the traditions of the retiarii are possibly even older than the knight, stemming from the ancient and humble fishergriff forced to fight. While not boasting the physical toughness of the knight, the retiarii boast great speed on the march, and can stubbornly dig themselves in to hold back even an armored assault."

 SIC_tech_knights2_desc:0 "Through the use of improved training and equipment, we can strengthen our Retiarii Divisions."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical:0 "Professionalize the Retiarii"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "Traditionally the retiarii have been an irregular force, acquiring their skills through their own experience and older fighters passing on their wisdom. Turning these great militia bands into even greater special forces units is only a natural evolution. Their lesser numbers also means we can provide them with more niche and experimental weapons and equipment."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2:0 "The Griffons of Maritime Myth"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "No one less than the very most elite in both mental and physical prowess will be accepted to train and obtain the honored title of a Rediario, and through this these units will be feared as the stuff of legend, in the realm of sea monsters and Sycaecia herself."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular:0 "Maintain Egalitarian Standards"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "The retiarii have always stood as a symbol of equality, that any common griffon can take up what arms they have and fight off any would be oppressor. To stratify our troops by imposing stricter standards would be blasphemous to what they stand for."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2:0 "Legions of the Sea"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "Any griffon can attain the legendary title of Rediario if they train themselves hard enough and prove themselves in battle, and together they are like the great ocean waves combined with wit and soul: confounding and indefatigable. They are truly legions of the sea."

The Celestia was designed in response to those requirements, and, while it suffered from mechanical issues due to its weight and the failure of hoped-for magitek engine and transmission system components to be manufacturable on an adequate scale, it was judged to be generally effective in those roles."

 VAN_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially conceived to support a spearhead by the (ultimately shelved) Ursa Major, the (now ironically named) Ursa Minor refined the Celestia's design. Longer, with a new turret, and larger main gun, its mechanical systems were improved, and the armor somewhat reworked. It was effective as an improved breakthrough tank, but the mechanical issues were not entirely solved and it remained quite slow."

 VAN_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Breezie"
 VAN_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As tanks developed, two different schools of thought arose on their use in the Equestrian military. The 'Gallopists' foresaw the need for a new, rapid response capability to counter the recent rise in surprise Changeling incursions and infiltrations, and other, previously unanticipated, threats. Their initial light tank design, the Breezie, was very fast, but poorly armed and armoured. Never intended for a full scale war, delays in its replacement and increasing border incursions led to it being refined and produced in larger than planned numbers."

 VAN_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Muletilda"
 VAN_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Hastily proposed for rapid design and deployment after the shocking Canterlot attack by Queen Chrysalis, the Muletilda was plagued by changing requirements, competing designs, and bureaucratic interference. The final result, once efforts to make room for wings of pegasi crew members were abandoned, was as idiosyncratic as its development, and little resembled other Equestrian designs. The Muletilda was lightly armoured, had limited firepower, but was fast, reliable, and a massive improvement over the Breezie."

 VAN_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Rainbow"
 VAN_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially a Muletilda replacement, the Rainbow's development was massively delayed due to its design being 'appropriated and adjusted' for the Timberwolf, a temporary Twilight stand-in. When the lighter Rainbow design was finally ready, it was arguably already obsolete, as Equestria struggled to repel the seemingly endless tide of well armoured Changeling Panzers."

 VAN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experience with the Muletilda quickly demonstrated that tanks with greater protection and firepower were needed. Work on a new design, the Twilight, began, but progressed so slowly that a stopgap was required. The result was the Timberwolf, a modification of the incomplete Rainbow project, with a new engine, more armor, redesigned turret, and larger main gun added. The Timberwolf was the first Equestrian tank to combine adequate speed, respectable armour, and significant firepower."

 VAN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The story of the Twilight is the story of the Equestrian war in microcosm. An ambitious magitek design proposed at the onset of the Great War, its development began in an era of administrative chaos and was badly delayed. Ambition met reality, and the magitek elements were abandoned due to a lack of required specialist unicorn mechanics. When the Twilight finally began production, Equestria was a new, reformed military machine, and it symbolised the awakening of Equestrian military power."

Arriving in time to lead the drive into the heart of the Changeling Lands, Comet tanks became a symbol of Equestrian liberation and victory, as they rolled through formerly occupied towns of cheering deer and sullen, defeated, hives."
