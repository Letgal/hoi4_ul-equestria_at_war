  civwar.10.d: "Із поразкою Еквестрії, тепер над усім панує [From.GetName], і їхній уряд виміг, щоби ми допустили їхніх чиновників до нагляду за державою із кінцевою метою реінтеграції з їхньою державою."

  civwar.16.d: "Подолавши довгий шлях Півднем, до нас прибув представник центрального уряду, який вимагає, щоби ми офіційно реінтегрувалися з Еквестрією. Хоча поні Південних Штатів пишаються своєю нацією, факт у тім, що в нас є мало шансів супротив величезної моці центрального уряду. Що нам робити?"
  civwar.16.a: "Ми опиратимемося цій агресії з півночі. До бою!"

  civwar.160.d: "Наше місто процвітає, і схоже Еквестрія нарешті виступила назустріч незалежності нашого міста. До Лас-Пегаса прибув високопосадовець із Еквестрії, який вимагає повернення Лас-Пегаса у склад Еквестрії в якості держави-підданиці. Якщо ми поступимося, всі наші зусилля будуть зведені нанівець. Однак, якщо ми відмовимо, ризикуємо зустріти міць еквестрійської армії. Доля Лас-Пегаса цілком може полягати в цьому виборі."

 civwar.21.t: "Пропозиція держави [From.GetName]"
  civwar.21.d: "Держава [From.GetName] запропонувала нам можливість приєднатися до їхньої республіки. Однак, ми впевнені, що вони просто бажають забрати джунглі собі."

 civwar.11.d:0 "A secret shipment of equipment, sent by the Empress herself, has just arrived in our area of control. Our soldiers met the leader, Misty Night, and thanked her for ensuring the delivery reached its destination safely without being discovered by our enemy. We now have thousands of additional rifles, helmets, bullets, grenades and more, all of which are sorely needed by our forces. Now we must distribute them to the frontline, and bid farewell to Misty Night and her brave soldiers."
 civwar.11.a: "Вдяка Місяцеві за цей дарунок!"
civwar.12.t: "Еквестрія просить реінтеграцію"
 civwar.12.d:0 "A representative from the central government of Equestria has arrived today to request our reintegration into Equestria. Our government would cease to exist, and our military and all provinces currently under our control will be transferred to the control of Equestrtia. While this is a hard pill to swallow for many it may be the only option we have besides dying against the might of the Equestrian juggernaut."
 civwar.12.a:0 "Better to die a revolutionary than live as a reactionary!"
 civwar.12.b:0 "Retirement sounds like a good idea."
civwar.13.t: "Еквестрія просить реінтеграцію"
 civwar.13.d:0 "Earlier today a representative of Equestria arrived in the harbor via rowboat. They came bearing a request from the central government that we go and have ourselves be reintegrated into Equestria now that the civil war is over. This would mean we would cease to exist as a nation, but also that further bloodshed would be avoided. Many would seek to reintegrate with Equestria, but on the other hoof we did build all these forts."
 civwar.13.a:0 "We can take 'em, eh?"
 civwar.13.b:0 "This was never aboot fighting to the last..."
civwar.14.t:0 "Help From the Rogue Province"
 civwar.14.d:0 "As Equestria's war against us ramps up some in the government have proposed that we request for help from the original revolutionaries in Stalliongrad. It would mean that they could get a spot at the table when the peace deal eventually comes, but on the other hoof we need every warm body we can muster to fight against the Equestrians and they do have a lovely spot for a second front."
 civwar.14.a:0 "We need Equestria's troops there not here, send the request."
 civwar.14.b:0 "We don't need their interference."
civwar.15.t: "Копито та молот проти Найтмер?"
 civwar.15.d:0 "When the civil war first began Stalliongrad seized large amounts of territory from the Lunar Empire. Now that Nightmare Moon has turned her guns against us we could reach out to them diplomatically to see if they are willing to seize even more territory for the revolution. The fact that this will take pressure off of us is just a side benefit, we will assure them."
 civwar.15.a:0 "We shall convince our revolutionary brothers of this goal!"
 civwar.15.b:0 "We're better off fighting for the true revolution here in the south."
civwar.22.t: "Пропозиція від Балтимейру"
 civwar.22.d:0 "The Baltimare Republic has recently sent us envoys that claim that the Baltimare Republic wishes us to join their union. We should tread carefully we don't know how they will react should we reject their "generous" offer."
 civwar.22.a:0 "Why not, let's try this whole Socialism thing."

### СУПЕР ТАЄМНА ЛАНКА ПОДІЙ ДАРК ВІНҐА ###
 conspiracy.3.t:0 "Equestrian Investment"
 conspiracy.3.d:0 "It seems that our new ties to Equestria have brought some good to us after all, as several industrialists from Canterlot have decided to invest in new factories on our soil, while some may call letting the bourgeoisie operate factories on our soil a betrayal to the revolution eventually they shall learn that it is merely but a means to an end."
 conspiracy.3.a:0 "We thank our Equestrian "friends" for their generosity."
 conspiracy.4.t:0 "New Roads"
 conspiracy.4.d:0 "With our new ties to Equestria the Princess has deemed it fit to build a new set of roads in our domain, and while we have been provided both the funds and resources to actually construct the roads it makes the government look like Celestia's stooges."
 conspiracy.4.a:0 "A connected nation is a united nation!"
 conspiracy.5.t:0 "Armouries"
 conspiracy.5.d:0 "It seems that despite our former secession from Equestria that the Royal Army has decided to open up several new armouries in our land to ensure our "safety", needless to say while it does provide us with a source of military equipment it also achieves the effect of confirming Stalliongrad's status as an Equestrian subject."
 conspiracy.5.a:0 "I'm glad that Equestria is ensuring our "safety""
 conspiracy.6.t:0 "Industrialisation"
 conspiracy.6.d:0 "After many years of hard work, and with a bit of funding from Equestria, we've finally managed to completely industrialise our nation, and we've got our own General Secretary to thank for that."
 conspiracy.6.a:0 "That's nice."
 conspiracy.7.t:0 "A Great Tragedy"
 conspiracy.7.d:0 "Disaster has struck Stalliongrad. On the morning of March 17th, an explosion rocked the palace of the Grand Soviet, setting off a small fire and killing a number of council officials. An investigation is currently underway, but there is nothing that could lead to a culprit, and authorities are not confident of finding such evidence any time soon. Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony's not pleased with the current administration."
 conspiracy.7.a:0 "We will not be cowed by terrorists!"
 conspiracy.8.t:0 "A Nation United"
 conspiracy.8.d:0 "It has been several days since the Grand Soviet bombing, and life in Stalliongrad has returned to normal. Surprisingly enough, despite coming up short with any credible suspects, the current administration has seen a surge of support in the aftermath of the attack. While the act was clearly motivated by politics, most civilians see it as a national tragedy as indicated by the vigils held in honour of the victims. General Secretary Dark Wing was quick to seize on this wave of solidarity and participated in the vigils as well. This has been received positively by the nation, and it is expected to increase support for the current party."
 conspiracy.8.a:0 "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger!"
 conspiracy.9.t:0 "Responsibility"
 conspiracy.9.d:0 "Any hopes that the attack was merely Changeling sabotage or some outside force was quickly dashed today as group calling themselves "Red Dawn" claimed responsibility for the attack on the Grand Soviet. Hijacking several radio broadcasts across the nation they proceeded to denounce General Secretary Dark Wing as a "bourgeoisie puppet" and a "traitor to the revolution", even more worrisome however is their declaration that they will fight our government until a true dictatorship of the proletariat is restored to Stalliongrad. Unfortunately what they failed to account for was the sheer amount of loved ones lost making the ponies rally behind Dark Wing and his government in these dark times."
 conspiracy.9.a:0 "The game is on..."
 conspiracy.10.t:0 "The Hunt"
 conspiracy.10.d:0 "Needless to say nopony is happy with the recent turn of events. Ponies have lost their loved ones, the Supreme Soviet is in ruins and to make it all worse we have traitors within our midst. However the General Secretary has recently received several anonymous tips that could lead us to the traitor's hiding place..."
 conspiracy.10.a:0 "The first tip said to investigate the forests around Sovenok."
 conspiracy.10.b:0 "The second tip said to investigate Downtown St. Petershoof."
 conspiracy.10.c:0 "The third tip said to investigate the Mountains around Zayatsk."
 conspiracy.11.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.11.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving through the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.11.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.12.t:0 "Petershoof"
 conspiracy.12.d:0 "It seems that the Petershoof tip was in fact either a red herring or completely false as after two moons of investigation all we've managed to accomplish is waste some ponypower and embarrass the government."
 conspiracy.12.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.13.d:0 "Following the second tip our troops searched through the mountains around Zayatsk for nearly a moon, and after nearly a moon of searching had almost given up hope until they managed to find a small rebel camp not in the mountains but the forests a bit south of Zayatsk. The evidence acquired from this camp is pointing towards the town of Sovenok."
 conspiracy.13.a:0 "To Sovenok we go..."
 conspiracy.14.t:0 "The Battle at Sovenok"
 conspiracy.14.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.14.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.15.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.15.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, the prisoners we've captured have in fact confirmed that the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn has been killed."
 conspiracy.15.a:0 "Splendid!"
 conspiracy.16.t:0 "The Celebration"
 conspiracy.16.d:0 "There was much fanfare today on the streets of Stalliongrad as General Secretary Dark Wing proclaimed our victory over the vicious terrorist organisation known as the Red Dawn. The celebration lasted for nearly as even Dark Wing's staunchest critics partook in the revelry. The celebration and was concluded by a speech from the General Secretary himself promising a new age for Stalliongrad, an age of prosperity, freedom and most importantly friendship..."
 conspiracy.16.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad!"
 conspiracy.17.t:0 "The Hunt Continues"
 conspiracy.17.d:0 "Despite our failure to find anything in Petershoof we can still fix this, let us follow the other two tips."
 conspiracy.17.a:0 "To Zayatsk."
 conspiracy.17.b:0 "To Sovenok."
 conspiracy.18.t:0 "The General Secretary's Plan"
 conspiracy.18.d:0 "No one really expected it, but as the citizens of Stalliongrad woke up today beneath the old red flag of Stalliongrad one thing was for certain, something had happened. As if one our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, soon enough the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by our beloved General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to our fair land, but to all of Equestria..."
 conspiracy.18.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad! Long live Dark Wing!"
 conspiracy.21.t:0 "The Grand Speech"
 conspiracy.21.d:0 "In a speech today, Stalliongrad's General Secretary, Dark Wing has officially declared himself Supreme Leader of The Greater Equestrian Union and has announced the nation's transition into what he called National Communism, a new, radical take on the already widely-regarded as radical ideology that is communism, following Dark Wing's specific and pragmatic views on the world. Furthermore, he spoke out against Equestria, vowing to liberate the oppressed workers throughout their territory, as well as vowing to put down the supremacist Changelings for the good of everypony."
 conspiracy.21.a:0 "Is it really communism?"
 conspiracy.22.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.22.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving through the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.22.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.23.t:0 "The Battle at Sovenok"
 conspiracy.23.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.23.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.24.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.24.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, however with the death of all the defenders we might never know if we killed the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn..."
 conspiracy.24.a:0 "Oh well."
 conspiracy.25.t:0 "Choosing our Capital"
 conspiracy.25.d:0 "With Celestria' corrupt regime done, and the Greater Equestrian Union in control of the majority of Equestria's metropolitan capitals it's about time we chose where our government shall be housed."
 conspiracy.25.a:0 "Canterlot."
 conspiracy.25.b:0 "Manehattan."
 conspiracy.25.c:0 "Stalliongrad."

 griffonian.0.d:0 "Unlike the Ponies to the East the Griffons had no Gods to guide them to unification, nor great diplomats to mend their differences.\n\nThere was no Heart's Warming eve to unite the various Kingdoms of old, but only blood and iron.\n\nFor hundreds, if not thousands of years, Griffon waged war against Griffon until the fateful day that King Grover I of Griffonstone found the Idol of Boreas and used it's power to unite all of the Griffon Kingdoms into one.\n\nThe newly founded Griffonian Empire would prosper for hundreds of years under the guidance of Grover's descendants, however that all came to an end with the reign of King Guto, as he lost the Idol of Boreas.\n\nOver the years, the Idol had come to be seen as the symbol of Imperial power, and with it's disappearance, disasters followed.\n\nFor years the Empire was ravaged by famine, disease, rampant rebellions and the ever increasing decadence of the nobility.\n\nNow, we stand at the precipice of history - the Empire is nearly in ruins, the Griffons once more at each others throats and the future is uncertain.\n\nCan we carve out a place for ourselves in this dangerous world?"

 griffonian.7.d:0 "The communist revolutionaries of Prywhen have acquired huge influence on the griffon politics in recent years. Some even say that the fate of the all griffon race is now in their claws. Then, it is time for us to decide our own fate! Shall the declare war on communism and push the Prywhen revolutionaries back where they came from, or should we, perhaps, join them?"

 scs.1.d:0 "Ever since the turbulent Declaration of Secession, Chairman Silverstar has valiantly lead us through those trying times. With situation stabilised somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species. With the election day drawing near, emotions are running high, and the winner is uncertain."

While they do not have official state support, they pledged their lives for the Confederation and the Southern Way."
 scs.2.a:0 "Three cheers for our Minuteponies!"

 scs.3.t:0 "Confederate Coast Guard"
 scs.3.d:0 "Southern ponies have never been great sailors - with boundless plains and endless deserts filling in for the sea.

 kasam.9.d:0 "Hesitantly the pony nodded, and his horn began to glow. Yet nothing happened. He realized this would be harder than anticipated. The glow intensified and his brow furrowed under the strain. Yet nothing happened. More and more energy was poured into his horn, until almost all of his magical power was being unleashed. A miniscule gap was torn open in the magical force field, accompanied by a terrible unnatural screech. Rachel immediately inserted the telescopic grabber into it, extending it fully. It could just barely reach the handle on the bell, and she managed to get a grasp on it. She pulled it back, but the bell could not fit through the hole, so she yelled at the pony to open it more.\n\nBut the pony was already at his limit, or so he felt like. In his mind, the sound of tolling bells echoed endlessly as sparks flew out of his horn. He had to do more, he had to, he simply had to.\n\nHe screamed and pushed all of his strength into his magic. The gap opened a little, just enough for the bell to fit through. Rachel pulled it out, and the pony collapsed unconscious. The gap closed instantly."

The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. Students who just became of age are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen these [Root.GetRaceMembers] are caught and interrogated, they point their [Root.GetHands] at the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on [Root.GetRaceMembers] avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse.

Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Even the number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and to make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught.

While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to frontline supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."

Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news has spread quickly, and it appears that most [Root.GetRaceMembers] who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.
