 modern_tank_equipment_x_4_desc:0 "A High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warhead relies on a shaped charge to punch through enemy armor and send a molten stream of it into the vehicle, causing catastrophic damage. It should be the primary anti-armor round used by our main battle tanks."

The smaller calibre sacrifices overall range and stopping power for better weapon handling, making the assault rifle more useful in tighter combat situations. New tactics developed in tandem with this new rifle change the old infantry combat dynamics, rendering our soldiers far deadlier than those of yesteryear."

 infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "New materials, lighter weapon accessories, and better equipment layouts have significantly improved upon previous iterations of our assault and battle rifles to the point that they have supplanted older bolt-action rifles as the service weapon. Submachine guns and bolt-action rifles are now effectively specialist weapons. In contrast, the versatile high-capacity automatic rifle is used by the rank-and-file, permanently changing the nature of infantry combat."
