civwar.16.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s Offer"
 civwar.16.d:0 "After a long trek through the south, a representative from the central government has arrived demanding that we officially reintegrate into Equestria. Although the Ponies of the Southern States are proud of their nation, the fact of the matter is that we would stand little chance against the massive might of the central government, what should we do?"

civwar.160.t:0 "Time Running Out"
 civwar.160.d:0 "As our city propers, it seems Equestria is finally making their move to take away the independence of our city. A dignitary from Equestria has arrived in Las Pegasus and is demanding Las Pegasus to be brought back into Equestria as a subject state. If we give in then all our efforts would have been for nothing. Yet if we refuse then we risk facing the might of the Equestrian army. The fate of Las Pegasus could very well be determined by this decision."

 civwar.11.d:0 "A secret shipment of equipment, sent by the Empress herself, has just arrived in our area of control. Our soldiers met the leader, Misty Night, and thanked her for ensuring the delivery reached its destination safely without being discovered by our enemy.

civwar.12.t:0 "Equestria Requests Reintegration"
 civwar.12.d:0 "A representative from the central government of Equestria has arrived today to request our reintegration into Equestria. Our government would cease to exist, and our military and all provinces currently under our control will be transferred to the control of Equestrtia. While this is a hard pill to swallow for many it may be the only option we have besides dying against the might of the Equestrian juggernaut."
 civwar.12.a:0 "Better to die a revolutionary than live as a reactionary!"
 civwar.12.b:0 "Retirement sounds like a good idea."
civwar.13.t:0 "Equestria Requests Reintegration"
 civwar.13.d:0 "Earlier today a representative of Equestria arrived in the harbor via rowboat. They came bearing a request from the central government that we go and have ourselves be reintegrated into Equestria now that the civil war is over. This would mean we would cease to exist as a nation, but also that further bloodshed would be avoided. Many would seek to reintegrate with Equestria, but on the other hoof we did build all these forts."
 civwar.13.a:0 "We can take 'em, eh?"
 civwar.13.b:0 "This was never aboot fighting to the last..."
civwar.14.t:0 "Help From the Rogue Province"
 civwar.14.d:0 "As Equestria's war against us ramps up some in the government have proposed that we request for help from the original revolutionaries in Stalliongrad. It would mean that they could get a spot at the table when the peace deal eventually comes, but on the other hoof we need every warm body we can muster to fight against the Equestrians and they do have a lovely spot for a second front."
 civwar.14.a:0 "We need Equestria's troops there not here, send the request."
 civwar.14.b:0 "We don't need their interference."
civwar.15.t:0 "The Hoof and Hammer Against the Moon?"
 civwar.15.d:0 "When the civil war first began Stalliongrad seized large amounts of territory from the Lunar Empire. Now that Nightmare Moon has turned her guns against us we could reach out to them diplomatically to see if they are willing to seize even more territory for the revolution. The fact that this will take pressure off of us is just a side benefit, we will assure them."
 civwar.15.a:0 "We shall convince our revolutionary brothers of this goal!"

 conspiracy.3.t:0 "Equestrian Investment"
 conspiracy.3.d:0 "It seems that our new ties to Equestria have brought some good to us after all, as several industrialists from Canterlot have decided to invest in new factories on our soil, while some may call letting the bourgeoisie operate factories on our soil a betrayal to the revolution eventually they shall learn that it is merely but a means to an end."
 conspiracy.3.a:0 "We thank our Equestrian "friends" for their generosity."
 conspiracy.4.t:0 "New Roads"
 conspiracy.4.d:0 "With our new ties to Equestria the Princess has deemed it fit to build a new set of roads in our domain, and while we have been provided both the funds and resources to actually construct the roads it makes the government look like Celestia's stooges."
 conspiracy.4.a:0 "A connected nation is a united nation!"
 conspiracy.5.t:0 "Armouries"
 conspiracy.5.d:0 "It seems that despite our former secession from Equestria that the Royal Army has decided to open up several new armouries in our land to ensure our "safety", needless to say while it does provide us with a source of military equipment it also achieves the effect of confirming Stalliongrad's status as an Equestrian subject."
 conspiracy.5.a:0 "I'm glad that Equestria is ensuring our "safety""
 conspiracy.6.t:0 "Industrialisation"
 conspiracy.6.d:0 "After many years of hard work, and with a bit of funding from Equestria, we've finally managed to completely industrialise our nation, and we've got our own General Secretary to thank for that."
 conspiracy.6.a:0 "That's nice."
 conspiracy.7.t:0 "A Great Tragedy"
 conspiracy.7.d:0 "Disaster has struck Stalliongrad. On the morning of March 17th, an explosion rocked the palace of the Grand Soviet, setting off a small fire and killing a number of council officials. An investigation is currently underway, but there is nothing that could lead to a culprit, and authorities are not confident of finding such evidence any time soon. Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony's not pleased with the current administration."
 conspiracy.7.a:0 "We will not be cowed by terrorists!"
 conspiracy.8.t:0 "A Nation United"
 conspiracy.8.d:0 "It has been several days since the Grand Soviet bombing, and life in Stalliongrad has returned to normal. Surprisingly enough, despite coming up short with any credible suspects, the current administration has seen a surge of support in the aftermath of the attack. While the act was clearly motivated by politics, most civilians see it as a national tragedy as indicated by the vigils held in honour of the victims. General Secretary Dark Wing was quick to seize on this wave of solidarity and participated in the vigils as well. This has been received positively by the nation, and it is expected to increase support for the current party."
 conspiracy.8.a:0 "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger!"
 conspiracy.9.t:0 "Responsibility"
 conspiracy.9.d:0 "Any hopes that the attack was merely Changeling sabotage or some outside force was quickly dashed today as group calling themselves "Red Dawn" claimed responsibility for the attack on the Grand Soviet. Hijacking several radio broadcasts across the nation they proceeded to denounce General Secretary Dark Wing as a "bourgeoisie puppet" and a "traitor to the revolution", even more worrisome however is their declaration that they will fight our government until a true dictatorship of the proletariat is restored to Stalliongrad. Unfortunately what they failed to account for was the sheer amount of loved ones lost making the ponies rally behind Dark Wing and his government in these dark times."
 conspiracy.9.a:0 "The game is on..."
 conspiracy.10.t:0 "The Hunt"
 conspiracy.10.d:0 "Needless to say nopony is happy with the recent turn of events. Ponies have lost their loved ones, the Supreme Soviet is in ruins and to make it all worse we have traitors within our midst. However the General Secretary has recently received several anonymous tips that could lead us to the traitor's hiding place..."
 conspiracy.10.a:0 "The first tip said to investigate the forests around Sovenok."
 conspiracy.10.b:0 "The second tip said to investigate Downtown St. Petershoof."
 conspiracy.10.c:0 "The third tip said to investigate the Mountains around Zayatsk."
 conspiracy.11.t:0 "Sovenok"
 conspiracy.11.d:0 "It seems that the tip the urging the General Secretary to investigate Sovenok was in fact true, as when we sent a regiment to Sovenok several of the locals confirmed that there were in fact strangers moving through the small town and congregating at a local summer camp in the woods..."
 conspiracy.11.a:0 "Lets see what we find in the camp..."
 conspiracy.12.t:0 "Petershoof"
 conspiracy.12.d:0 "It seems that the Petershoof tip was in fact either a red herring or completely false as after two moons of investigation all we've managed to accomplish is waste some ponypower and embarrass the government."
 conspiracy.12.a:0 "Back to the drawing board then..."
 conspiracy.13.t:0 "Zayatsk"
 conspiracy.13.d:0 "Following the second tip our troops searched through the mountains around Zayatsk for nearly a moon, and after nearly a moon of searching had almost given up hope until they managed to find a small rebel camp not in the mountains but the forests a bit south of Zayatsk. The evidence acquired from this camp is pointing towards the town of Sovenok."
 conspiracy.13.a:0 "To Sovenok we go..."
 conspiracy.14.t:0 "The Battle at Sovenok"
 conspiracy.14.d:0 "It seems that our suspicions have proven to be correct as when our valiant troops found the camp they were fired upon from all sides..."
 conspiracy.14.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"
 conspiracy.15.t:0 "Victory"
 conspiracy.15.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, the prisoners we've captured have in fact confirmed that the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn has been killed."
 conspiracy.15.a:0 "Splendid!"
 conspiracy.16.t:0 "The Celebration"
 conspiracy.16.d:0 "There was much fanfare today on the streets of Stalliongrad as General Secretary Dark Wing proclaimed our victory over the vicious terrorist organisation known as the Red Dawn. The celebration lasted for nearly as even Dark Wing's staunchest critics partook in the revelry. The celebration and was concluded by a speech from the General Secretary himself promising a new age for Stalliongrad, an age of prosperity, freedom and most importantly friendship..."
 conspiracy.16.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad!"
 conspiracy.17.t:0 "The Hunt Continues"
 conspiracy.17.d:0 "Despite our failure to find anything in Petershoof we can still fix this, let us follow the other two tips."
 conspiracy.17.a:0 "To Zayatsk."
 conspiracy.17.b:0 "To Sovenok."
 conspiracy.18.t:0 "The General Secretary's Plan"
 conspiracy.18.d:0 "No one really expected it, but as the citizens of Stalliongrad woke up today beneath the old red flag of Stalliongrad one thing was for certain, something had happened. As if one our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, soon enough the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by our beloved General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to our fair land, but to all of Equestria..."
 conspiracy.18.a:0 "Long live Stalliongrad! Long live Dark Wing!"
 conspiracy.21.t:0 "The Grand Speech"
 conspiracy.21.d:0 "In a speech today, Stalliongrad's General Secretary, Dark Wing has officially declared himself Supreme Leader of The Greater Equestrian Union and has announced the nation's transition into what he called National Communism, a new, radical take on the already widely-regarded as radical ideology that is communism, following Dark Wing's specific and pragmatic views on the world. Furthermore, he spoke out against Equestria, vowing to liberate the oppressed workers throughout their territory, as well as vowing to put down the supremacist Changelings for the good of everypony."
 conspiracy.21.a:0 "Is it really communism?"
 conspiracy.22.t:0 "Sovenok"

 conspiracy.24.d:0 "After several days of hard fighting our troops have managed to free the camp of any traitors within, however with the death of all the defenders we might never know if we killed the mysterious leader of the Red Dawn..."
 conspiracy.24.a:0 "Oh well."
 conspiracy.25.t:0 "Choosing our Capital"

 griffonian.0.d:0 "Unlike the Ponies to the East the Griffons had no Gods to guide them to unification, nor great diplomats to mend their differences.\n\nThere was no Heart's Warming eve to unite the various Kingdoms of old, but only blood and iron.\n\nFor hundreds, if not thousands of years, Griffon waged war against Griffon until the fateful day that King Grover I of Griffonstone found the Idol of Boreas and used it's power to unite all of the Griffon Kingdoms into one.\n\nThe newly founded Griffonian Empire would prosper for hundreds of years under the guidance of Grover's descendants, however that all came to an end with the reign of King Guto, as he lost the Idol of Boreas.\n\nOver the years, the Idol had come to be seen as the symbol of Imperial power, and with it's disappearance, disasters followed.\n\nFor years the Empire was ravaged by famine, disease, rampant rebellions and the ever increasing decadence of the nobility.\n\nNow, we stand at the precipice of history - the Empire is nearly in ruins, the Griffons once more at each others throats and the future is uncertain.\n\nCan we carve out a place for ourselves in this dangerous world?"

With situation stabilised somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species.

Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furore has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid.

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the supremacist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss Supremacy as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbours and a supremacist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favour of democratic reforms.

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many supremacists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure.

Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means.

Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on [Root.GetRaceMembers] avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."

Even the number of [Root.GetRaceMembers] applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and to make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught.

 mutiny_event.2.a:0 "We could not have predicted this."
 mutiny_event.3.t:0 ""What ARE we fighting for?""
 mutiny_event.3.desc:0 ""It's not uncommon for a soldier to doubt whether what he or she is doing is really worth it. Can anything justify the sacrifices we ask of you? Can we really demand of you to potentially die in pursuit of a goal that you would never see?\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that we must live in the times we were born in. Fate has decreed that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war; it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."
 mutiny_event.3.a:0 "Good speech."

 mutiny_event.4.desc:0 "While the War Office is doing its best to keep the current mutiny in the army from becoming widely known, censoring letters can only go so far. Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nWithout mentioning the mutiny specifically, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that the government would now consider any act that reflected a lack of commitment to the war to be treason.\n\nThe punishment for treason is well known, and public support for the mutineers has all but evaporated. News of this was, of course, widely spread. Seeing little support from the general population, the soldiers have quietly resumed their duties."

 mutiny_event.5.desc:0 "While the War Office is doing its best to keep the current mutiny in the army from becoming widely known, censoring letters can only go so far. Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nAttempts by the government to stem the tide have completely failed. Reports from the Secret Police indicate that the mutineers have a strong backing from the general public, making it unlikely that we can isolate and suppress them."

 mutiny_event.6.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Peace Offer"
 mutiny_event.6.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] announced to the press today that his latest peace offer has failed. While the causes for this unfortunate turn of events are very complex, the [Root.GetAdjective] demand that the other side pay for all damages caused, disarm completely and publicly acknowledge that they started the war may have been the final straw.\n\nOur enemies have responded in kind, calling our reasonable requests a demand for unconditional surrender. They have promised that they will prosecute this war until the bitter end. \n\nWith our enemies evidently unwilling to see reason and promising to fight on, attempts by the mutineers to force a peace settlement have collapsed."
 mutiny_event.6.a:0 "Terrible shame."
 mutiny_event.7.t:0 "Military Crackdown succeeds."
 mutiny_event.7.desc:0 "Despite a few instances in which small groups of mutineers decided to make a fight out of it, our operation to crush the rebellion has been a stunning success. Relying on numbers rather than skill, loyalist militias surrounded the mutineers' strongholds and demanded their surrender. Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own and surrendered peacefully. \n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent the mutineers from forming new cells."
 mutiny_event.7.a:0 "Well done."
 mutiny_event.8.t:0 "Fighting Our Own"
 mutiny_event.8.desc:0 "Our attempts to prevent the elections for the Worker and Soldier Councils have escalated the situation beyond even the most pessimistic estimation. Rather than surrendering, the mutineers have formed provisional Councils, elected field commanders and set up defences in the streets. It is clear that they aim to make a fight out of this.\n\nThe rifts in the army now run through every unit and often even between members of the same family. [Root.GetNameDefCap] may soon be a battleground."

 mutiny_event.9.t:0 "A New Breed of Officer"
 mutiny_event.9.desc:0 "Despite strong objections from the military, every unit in the [Root.GetAdjective] Army carried out elections to select their commander. The results have been very surprising, as most of the newly elected officers are accomplished soldiers with plenty of experience in the field. While many career officers still consider this to be a personal insult, there can be little doubt that most soldiers dramatically prefer this situation."

Will this force [From.From.Owner.GetName] to surrender to avoid further terror, or will it only strengthen their resolve to strike back against those who would resort to such measures?"
