 gwtank_chassis:0 "Early Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc:0 "Inspired by the tales of Griffonian Knights with their heavy armour and equally heavy weaponry, the first tanks were created in 996 during their revolution by Stalliongrad ponies. Slow, mechanically unreliable, and poorly armoured, these rushed conversions of agricultural equipment were nonetheless effective against lightly armed infantry, and thus copied and imitated widely."

 armor_tech_1:0 "Welded Armour"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Winter Revolution only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Spaced Armour"
 armor_tech_2_desc:0 "Alongside the development of High Explosive Anti-Tank shells was born the need to discover a method of protecting armoured targets against them. Recent trials of spaced armour have achieved the desired levels of protection by utilising an initial armour plate to trigger the fuse of the HEAT shell followed by open air which cools and unfocuses the jet of molten metal before it collides with a second - typically thicker - armour plate."
 armor_tech_3:0 "Appliqué Armour"
 armor_tech_3_desc:0 "Utilised in response to the rising penetrative capabilities of enchanted Griffonian shells, Aquileian 'appliqué armour' is as simple as grafting additional armour or layers of other materials to the outside of a tank. Besides the addition of secondary steel plates, everything from spare tank tracks to sandbags and layers of concrete have been observed to have some positive impact on the armour of tanks, though not without sacrificing their speed."
 armor_tech_4:0 "Improved Rolled Homohenous Steel Armour"
 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "Rolling steel into a more homogenous plate already strengthens its resistance to shocks, such as high-speed impacts, and heat treating it afterwards can further harden it. However, we've found that heating armour plates at a particular point offers them extra hardness without necessarily increasing their weight while avoiding brittleness. Thus, we can provide our tank crews with the best protection with steel armour."

 engine_tech_1:0 "Converted Tractor Engines"
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Though relatively primitive, tractor engines and those found in other heavy farm machinery are reliable and are typically designed with heavy loads in mind. The additional weight of tank armour, a gun and the ammunition for it are a step above what these engines were originally designed to carry; but they are by no means ineffective. A slow tank that needs occasional engine and drivetrain repairs is better than no tank at all."
 engine_tech_2:0 "Dedicated Tank Engines"
 engine_tech_2_desc:0 "Having recognised and worked to rectify the issues presented by overburdened tractor engines, dedicated parts and entire engine assemblies that are fully capable of carrying tens of tons are finally becoming available in large numbers. Though they are still showing signs of struggle with newer designs that sport even more armour and larger guns, these dedicated engines represent a significant step forward for the operational capabilities of our tanks."
 engine_tech_3:0 "Improved Engine Tuning"
 engine_tech_3_desc:0 "Though they require mass manufacturing, tank engines are still precise machines that benefit from small tolerances and continuous design iterations. Whilst the quantities in which they're needed make it prudent to avoid making frequent changes during production runs, rolling many small changes and alterations to manufacturing processes into one new engine model every few years has resulted in notable improvements in their performance over time."
 engine_tech_4:0 "Supercharged Engines"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "Despite the higher fuel consumption they necessitate and a number of reliability issues we have slowly managed to overcome during the testing phases, superchargers have demonstrated an impressive ability to improve the output of our engines or to reduce their displacement and weight whilst maintaining a similar power-to-weight ratio."

 modern_tank_chassis_desc:0 "The increasing emphasis and reliance on general-purpose medium tanks highlight the necessity of a vehicle that fills the role of armour-protected direct fire and manoeuvre that medium tanks fail to provide adequately. A new design idea for a universal tank has cropped up that offers the mobility of a light tank, the overall armour of a medium tank, and the firepower of a heavy tank. Initial tests hold great promise for this revolutionary concept."

 basic_light_tank_chassis_short: "Легке шасі 1005 р."
 light_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "Derived from earlier cavalry tank models, light tanks improve the previous iterations mainly by utilising improved speed and manoeuvrability. The smaller platform limits its offensive and defensive capabilities but should still prove to be a cost-effective tanks chassis for reconnaissance and fire-support duties."
 improved_light_tank_chassis_short: "Легке шасі 1007 р."
 light_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "As the cheaper alternative, light tanks appear to have a role in the upcoming era of mechanised warfare. Our newest chassis are made explicitly to use new drive trains and house more efficient engines while improving their armour, and this should make future light tank designs more effective in their roles."
 advanced_light_tank_chassis_short: "Легке шасі 1012 р."
 light_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The proliferation of heavier tanks has put into question the role of the light tanks. Experience has improved our light tank chassis, where the newest models can now mount armour and weaponry that would put them on par with earlier medium tanks. Should our industry not be up to the task, we can always rely on this chassis to be the foundation of our armoured forces."

 amphibious_tank_chassis_1: "Шасі танка-амфібії"
 amphibious_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The value of a tank designed for amphibious operations is evident but a considerable engineering challenge. Limited by weight and size, these chasses are most similar to other light tank designs but built with integrated pontoons or other flotation devices to allow them to traverse water. Though other drawbacks, such as light armour and armament, and a relatively slow speed on the water, limit the scope of these tanks, they are an essential step for armoured amphibious operations."

 amphibious_drive_desc:0 "The first generation of amphibious tanks proved unsatisfactory when operating on land due to their unwieldy hulls that often resembled more like those of boats. A possible solution is to create a set of modular flotation devices and a purpose-built screw that we can mount on most chassis, thus keeping their overall performance on land. Though not always reliable, amphibious drives are a versatile module."
