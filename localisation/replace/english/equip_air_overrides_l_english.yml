 fighter_equipment_0: "Ранній винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_0_short: "$fighter_equipment_0$"
 fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The past century was a gallant age of airships and Pegasi and Griffon sky knights. The original Griffon biplane was thus mocked by the old guard for being a "commoner's tool" of war. It was not until a token garrison of Hippogriff fighter wings inflicted heavy casualties on the Storm King's air fleet in 1005 that even critics finally conceded that the era of airships had ended."
 fighter_equipment_1: "Базовий винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_1_short: "$fighter_equipment_1$"
 fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Shifting away from the biplane design principle to that of the monoplane does make the aircraft less agile overall but gains considerable speed. This, along with the first truly all-metal fuselage and dedicated aero engine, make these fighters speedy and capable of climbing far faster than previous fighters while being more survivable."
 fighter_equipment_2: "Поліпшений винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "We have found that our fighter aircraft are generally lacking in firepower. Either the armament is too low-calibre, lacks ammunition, or there simply isn't enough. Too often, our pilots run out of ammo or waste time pouring lead into larger or armoured aircraft. Reliable automatic cannons, enlarged magazines, or even additional weapons can be enough to solve this deficiency. Of course, the airframe and engine are updated accordingly."
 fighter_equipment_3: "Удосконалений винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. винищувач"
 fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Hard-fought lessons learned in the last years have demonstrated that, in general, the fighter operating at a higher altitude has a distinct advantage over the one at a lower altitude. Refinements in the fighter's weaponry keep it competitive against contemporary designs and deadly to older ones, while the early adoption of turboprops helps bring the aircraft to unprecedented heights beyond what normal creatures are meant to reach."

 cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Палубний винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "Used to the long range and flying time of the airship, militaries have searched for ways to extend the range of the powerful, but limited fighter craft. Just as airships were once hubs for griffons and pegasi soldiers, aircraft carriers became new hubs for these aircraft, much to the delight of unemployed airship crews seeking new homes."
 cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Базовий палубний винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Баз. палуб. винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The relative low stall speed of biplanes has made the introduction of heavier carrier monoplane aircraft challenging. In addition, their larger size also poses an engineering challenge in stowing the aircraft in the limited hangar space of aircraft carriers. Designing carrier fighters around weight and folding wings goes a long way to addressing these primary issues."
 cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Поліпшений палубний винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. палуб. винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "In general, carrier fighters don't require much of an upgrade in firepower like their land-based counterparts. However, lessons learned in improving the overall flight characteristics of the latter can be implemented in the former. Redesigning our fuselages to enhance the agility and speed of our carrier fighters makes it more likely that our carrier-based fighters will come out on top when fighting the enemy."
 cv_fighter_equipment_3: "Удосконалений палубний винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. палуб. винищувач"
 cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The greatest asset of carrier-based aircraft is their range. We've extended their operational range in previous iterations via additional integrated fuel or drop tanks. However, this is both inefficient and costly in fuel. Air resistance at low altitudes is a significant limiter of our carrier fighters' range. By cruising at higher altitudes, our fighters use less fuel and can go farther than ever."

 CAS_equipment_1: "Базовий штурмовик"
 CAS_equipment_1_short: "$CAS_equipment_1$"
 CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "The impact of aircraft on the battlefield has already been felt by bombers unloading their payload on enemy positions. However, even the smaller tactical bombers are only effective at striking large, mostly immobile targets. A novel idea is making the rounds: light aircraft that provide close air support by hitting smaller targets, such as tanks or large unit formations with smaller but more precise bombs, by diving unto the enemy. Such craft will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies on the ground."
 CAS_equipment_2: "Поліпшений штурмовик"
 CAS_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. штурмовик"
 CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Early CAS have been designed deliberately to fly at low speeds to allow more precise dive bombing, but this has turned into a liability, leaving them vulnerable to enemy ground fire and pursuing fighters. We've tuned the airframe where possible to make these CAS bombers more manoeuvrable and speedier when not on attack runs and made it possible to mount larger payloads. Some experiments in anti-tank cannons and rocket rails also show great promise."
 CAS_equipment_3: "Удосконалений штурмовик"
 CAS_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. штурмовик"
 CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Should a CAS bomber be caught while unescorted, it is doubtful it'll make it back to base in one piece. This is why we should move away from yesteryear's fragile aircraft and instead focus on making them more survivable while still reasonably fast. Embracing the concept of rockets and anti-tank cannons allows this new generation of CAS to forego the dangerous dive bomb. It will still carry bombs to keep it versatile against many targets."

 cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Базовий палубний штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "Баз. палуб. штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Our carriers require an aircraft that can strike land targets beyond the range of the guns of our larger ships. A dive bomber may not carry the same ordinance as larger bombers, but it is a viable choice, being suitably small and having a low stall speed. Additionally, carrier-based CAS can also prove to be effective against enemy ships when armed with armour-piercing bombs."
 cv_CAS_equipment_2: "Поліпшений палубний штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. палуб. штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "The same vulnerability in land-based CAS bombers has also cropped up in our carrier CAS. Their slow and clunky flight characteristics make them easy prey to enemy fighters and the AA batteries of their target ships. We can increase the speed of our aircraft while allowing them to dive bomb with less risk with the use of dive breaks. This is still a difficult and dangerous procedure, but at least our pilots have a better chance of hitting their targets and getting away with it."
 cv_CAS_equipment_3: "Удосконалений палубний штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. палуб. штурмовик"
 cv_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Dive bombing has become unfeasible when attacking ships bristling with AA batteries. A CAS squadron may be able to run the gauntlet to score a hit, but the endeavour will inevitably be costly. As such, a new concept has taken shape: skip bombing. Between the rocket rails and heavier skip bombs, our carrier-based CAS can strike upon their targets without being as exposed to enemy counterfire as they would have been if dive bombing. "

 nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Базовий морський бомбардувальник"
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Баз. мор. бомбард."
 nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "An unexpected torpedo hit is one of the greatest threats to ships, while the depth charge is the perfect weapon against submarines. Planes designed to mount and deploy these weapons make them very cost-effective anti-shipping vehicles. What are a few downed bombers to a sunk dreadnought?"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Поліпшений морський бомбардувальник"
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. мор. бомбард."
 nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The vast oceans require a great operational range for our naval bombers to effectively cover our territorial waters. Their sluggishness is still a concern, but refinements in naval targeting equipment give our pilots a fighting chance against the defences they're bound to run into. More capable flight characteristics make newer models fly further and faster while carrying additional and heavier ordinance to sink the enemy ships."
 nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Удосконалений морський бомбардувальник"
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. мор. бомбард."
 nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "There's only so much we can do to improve the ordinance our naval bombers can unleash upon their targets. Only the bombers have room for improvement: greater operational range, higher speeds, enhanced agility, air-mounted RADAR, and more defensive armaments. With such aircraft, we will establish a domineering position that naval bombers enjoy over fleets unlike any other."

 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Базовий палубний морський бомбардувальник"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Баз. палуб. мор. бомбард."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The limitations imposed on carrier-based aircraft make torpedo bombers the ideal choice for a capable anti-shipping craft. The air-dropped torpedo is smaller than those launched from ships, but their close range makes it hard to dodge, especially if the target is a large, sluggish ship. This allows the aircraft carrier to pose a significant threat against the supposed 'Queens' of the seas, the dreadnoughts and battleships. "
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Поліпшений палубний морський бомбардувальник"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. палуб. мор. бомбард."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The strength of our carrier torpedo bombers is their capacity to strike hard from seemingly nowhere. With improved engines, they can come in faster and carry enhanced torpedo loads, giving less time for the enemy targets to react and boring larger holes in their hulls. These bombers give our aircraft carriers the bite they need to make them competitive on the high seas."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Удосконалений палубний морський бомбардувальник"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. палуб. мор. бомбард."
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "While our new carrier naval bombers are more capable than previous designs, the most significant breakthrough has been faster aerial torpedoes. Their higher speeds enable our bomber pilots to drop off their loads from further away without significantly improving the chances of the enemy target evading the strike. This increases the survivability of our precious aircraft and invaluable pilots while maintaining our aircraft carriers' effectiveness. "

 jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Базовий реактивний винищувач"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Баз. реакт. винищувач"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Jet engines are a revolutionary step forward in the world of aviation, and it would be foolish of us not to take advantage of them in our fighter aircraft. However, our understanding of aerodynamics still has to catch up to these incredible speeds. Our contemporary designs are notably sluggish in aerial combat but make excellent boom-and-zoom fighters, deadly against bomber squadrons."
 jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Поліпшений реактивний винищувач"
 jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. реакт. винищувач"
 jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Lessons learned with our early forays in jet aircraft have manifested themselves in the design of our newest jet fighters. Improvements to our turbine engines' lifespans diminish the costs in maintenance, the installation of ejection seats increase the survival rate of our pilots, and the implementation of swept wings and all-moving tailplanes makes the fighters far more responsive."

#Heavy Planes#
 tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Базовий тактичний бомбардувальник"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Баз. такт. бомбард."
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Considered an offshoot from strategic bombers, the tactical bomber is meant to fit in a versatile role of striking many different targets, be they on land or sea. Their medium-sized airframe keeps these tactical bombers somewhat agile and speedy enough to carry reasonably heavy ordinances to the enemy while being sufficiently survivable, capable of shrugging off enemy fire."
 tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Поліпшений тактичний бомбардувальник"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. такт. бомбард."
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Enlargening the airframe of our medium bombers allows for improved engines for speed, heavier ordinance, more fuel for greater range, and more defensive armaments to keep enemies at bay. Their flexibility keeps these bombers relevant for any mission role we may require when dedicated aircraft are unavailable."
 tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Удосконалений тактичний бомбардувальник"
 tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. такт. бомбард."
 tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Improved aerodynamic fuselages and material use to increase our tactical bombers' flight characteristics. In addition, implementing rockets and dedicated skip bombs opens up new attack angles and opportunities for the bombers. Finally, more intelligent placements of our defensive weapons make any potential pursuer think twice about engaging an armed bomber."

 heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Базовий важкий винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Баз. важк. винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Though our bombers are relatively large and armed with an array of defensive weaponry, they are still vulnerable to nimbler interceptors. Where they can, fighters escort our bombers to their targets, but the operational range of bombers far outstrips that of our regular fighters. Heavy fighters are the answer to this challenge. Armed with heavy weapons and generally twin-engined, heavy fighters trade agility and speed for range and killing power."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Поліпшений важкий винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. важк. винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Military observers have noted that heavy fighters, though able to keep up with their bombers, are not effective escorts against smaller fighters. However, their large airframes make for an excellent bomber interceptor. Adding on heavier aircraft cannons while keeping their speed and operational range keep these new heavy fighters competitive in contested skies."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Удосконалений важкий винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. важк. винищувач"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters risk falling by the wayside as modern fighters begin to cover greater and greater ranges, and the latter's combat performance outstrips the former's. We can enhance their survivability by adding armour plating and heavier defensive weapons, but it is becoming evident that even as interceptors, heavy fighters are a dead-end. However, this line of new models is the pinnacle of heavy fighter design."

 strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Базовий стратегічний бомбардувальник"
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Баз. страт. бомбард."
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Infrastructure destruction is recognised for its efficacy, and it has long been theorised that it could be carried out by air. Despite the flight capacity of many races, attacks deep behind enemy lines were previously impossible. Fliers could not safely carry full combat gear long distances, and sluggish airships met swift responses. Strategic bombers have changed this, able to deliver quick, long-range destruction anywhere, anytime."
 strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Поліпшений стратегічний бомбардувальник"
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. страт. бомбард."
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Strategic bombing of enemy infrastructure and logistics has yielded great, yet costly, results. Bombers capable of carrying out such missions are slow, lumbering targets that can easily fall prey to enemy interceptors and AA fire. Breakthroughs in bombsight technology and fuselages capable of reaching higher altitudes enable high-altitude level bombing, keeping our bombers at safe heights from most threats. Should the enemy come for them, the heavy defensive armament should be more than a match."
 strat_bomber_equipment_3: "Удосконалений стратегічний бомбардувальник"
 strat_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Удоскон. страт. бомбард."
 strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "There is a relatively simple solution for our strategic bombers to be more effective: enlargen the airframe further. The added space allows for more and larger bomb bays to devastate even the hardiest targets while additional fuel storage gives them incredible range. As for the threats posed by interceptors, where escorts cannot be present, the addition of several more heavy gunnery positions and armour plating will make our newest bombers veritable flying fortresses."

 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Базовий реактивний тактичний бомбардувальник"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Баз. реакт. такт. бомбард."
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The prospect of transonic bombers is a tantalising one, but there are some drawbacks in most contemporary designs. Specifically, the ordinance is relatively limited compared to heavier strategic bombers, and current understandings of aerodynamics make it challenging to mount many, if any, defensive weapons. Therefore, speed will be the primary defence of our jet bombers."
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Поліпшений реактивний тактичний бомбардувальник"
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Поліпш. реакт. такт. бомбард."
 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Our understanding of jet-based aviation has advanced enough to allow new tactical bombers to carry greater loads and even mount some turreted positions for self-defence. Their main form of defence remains their high speeds, and their capacity to rapidly strike the target area and leave it just as quickly makes them deadly."

 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Реактивний стратегічний бомбардувальник"
 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Реакт. страт. бомбард."
 jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "A new opportunity to develop a specially designed long-range penetration bomber has appeared. With new understandings of supersonic aviation and aerodynamics, strategic bombers equipped with high-performance jets enable them to fly high and far to deliver their deadly payloads. Along with modern air-to-ground RADAR, the accuracy of these strikes is nothing to scoff at."

 transport_plane_equipment_desc:0 "To landbound races, the ubiquity of air transport amongst flying races may seem odd. However, kitted out fliers cannot travel long distances without exhaustion. Modern fliers travel most of the distance by plane, jump out, and safely glide to the landing zone."

 transport_plane_equipment_2_short: "Поліпшений транспорт"
 transport_plane_equipment_2_desc:0 "The inherent value of transport planes has made itself evident, and we can do much more to improve the speed, survivability, and operational range of this aircraft category. The strengthening of the fuselage and refinement of its aerodynamic form exponentially increases the aircraft's performance, allowing it to reach distances at a considerably higher speed than previous models."

 transport_plane_equipment_3: "Сучасний транспортний літак"
 transport_plane_equipment_3_short: "Сучасний транспорт"
 transport_plane_equipment_3_desc:0 "We can take further steps to enhance the long-distance characteristics of our transport planes. With an improved understanding of avionic designs and aircraft construction, the newest iteration of transport planes can reach even further distances at even greater speeds without incurring major costs. These flying workhorses will serve our paratrooper and airborne units well, no matter where they are needed!"

#Misc. Planes#
 scout_plane_equipment_1: "Базовий розвідувальний літак"
 scout_plane_equipment_1_short: "Базовий розвідлітак"
 scout_plane_equipment_1_desc:0 "Previously, most aerial reconnaissance was done personally by winged creatures such as griffons and pegasi flying high. This, however, required incredibly fit and well-trained scouts. Planes can fly considerably higher and mount specially designed high-quality cameras that can take detailed photos while being substantially more survivable."
 scout_plane_equipment_2: "Поліпшений розвідувальний літак"
 scout_plane_equipment_2_short: "Поліпшений розвідлітак"
 scout_plane_equipment_2_desc:0 "Aerial reconnaissance has grown in importance, and the information a scout plane can obtain is vital to the enemy. This is why dedicated reconnaissance aircraft should strive for stealth to keep attention off just long enough to carry out their mission, be it by mounting a quieter engine, achieving a higher operational ceiling, or by something as simple as disguising the plane as a civilian aircraft."


##BBA PLANES (airframes)##
 small_plane_airframe_0: "Ранній малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "The past century was a gallant age of airships and Pegasi and Griffon sky knights. The original Griffon biplane was thus mocked by the old guard for being a "commoner's tool" of war. It was not until a token garrison of Hippogriff fighter wings inflicted heavy casualties on the Storm King's air fleet in 1005 that even critics finally conceded that the era of airships had ended. This particular range of airframes is mostly a continuation of those first biplanes, though it is evident that these are a dead-end for our military aviation."
 small_plane_airframe_1: "Базовий малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Though the first wave of light aircraft managed to prove themselves successors to the airships of old, they were not without a variety of faults and shortcomings. Technological developments have now allowed for the use of light metals across the entire fuselage, allowing for more robust designs that are both drastically more versatile and less easily damaged. Further improvements will surely come, but these new airframes are nevertheless a huge step forward."
 small_plane_airframe_2: "Поліпшений малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "As our aviation industry continues to develop and our pilots continue to provide feedback to designers, so too have our small aircraft gradually improved. Whilst the previous generation of fuselages were very capable, they lacked many important features and were not as deadly as was originally imagined. This new line of airframes has been built with a focus on ‘boom-and-zoom’ capability, allowing our pilots to climb high in order to then dive down and safely destroy both air and ground targets."
 small_plane_airframe_3: "Удосконалений малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "As time goes on, altitude and the element of surprise are becoming gradually less effective in providing guaranteed kills on enemy light aircraft and ground targets. Maximised agility —be it through impressively tight turning circles or capacity for complex manoeuvres—  is absolutely required to escape concentrated anti-air fire and enemy light aircraft. With this in mind, our new light airframes are now pushing the envelope of feasible designs in order to optimise flight characteristics and give us the edge over foreign designs."
 small_plane_airframe_4: "Напівсучасний малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "With the advent of modern engine technology that surpasses previous piston-based designs, speed and altitude have once again become dominant in air combat and air support doctrines. However, unlike the original ‘boom-and-zoom’ aircraft, such are the speeds achieved by these new aircraft that many new innovations have been made in order to keep them structurally sound during flight. New materials, innovative wing designs and dedicated air intakes have finally made them safe to use; though the rapid acceleration still makes our pilots uncomfortable."
 small_plane_airframe_5: "Сучасний малий авіакорпус"
 small_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "Since the adoption of jet technology and our early designs based around it, our light aircraft have seen considerable improvements in their combat capacity. Unfortunately, our pilots have also expressed their displeasure at both the middling survivability and lacking weapon capacity of the current generation of fighters in service. Now that we are beyond our first steps into the world of jet technology, we can focus on making our small airframes considerably more versatile and even less prone to sudden disassembly mid-flight."

 medium_plane_airframe_0: "Ранній середній авіакорпус"
 medium_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "Having merely been adapted from civilian aircraft, this airframe makes up for its shocking lack of speed and manoeuvrability with considerable versatility. Once the seats and luggage compartments are removed it's easy to turn these relatively primitive airliners into heavy fighters, reconnaissance aircraft or even tactical bombers. Preliminary testing indicates that they will perform with some efficacy, though we will advise the pilots to avoid being shot at all the same; even rifle fire can cause problems for these machines."
 medium_plane_airframe_1: "Базовий середній авіакорпус"
 medium_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Though the previous generation of medium airframes were far from useless, they left much to be desired in every aspect bar operational range. Particularly distressing to pilots was the casualty rate when unescorted which was unsurprisingly high, considering the origins of the converted aircraft they were flying. They will be relieved to know that the next generation of similarly sized aircraft will now be much less flimsy, faster and better armed thanks to our new dedicated fuselage designs."
 medium_plane_airframe_2: "Поліпшений середній авіакорпус"
 medium_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "Though the idea of a heavy fighter has become less and less appealing as smaller air superiority fighters continue to prove the importance of agility in dogfights, other aircraft based upon these moderately sized airframes have shown incredible promise. With improved wing designs to improve lift and more efficient use of internal space these aircraft can now travel further and with larger payloads than ever before."
 medium_plane_airframe_3: "Удосконалений середній авіакорпус"
 medium_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "By now it is apparent that the versatility of these intermediately sized aircraft comes with limitations, particularly in regards to the extent of their capability in any one field in comparison to dedicated aircraft operating in those fields. Despite this they continue to be of great developmental interest as iterative designs continually improve their defining feature of relative agility in spite of their large payload capacity. Proponents of heavy fighters meanwhile have been very quiet, though they haven't disappeared entirely."
 medium_plane_airframe_4: "Напівсучасний середній авіакорпус"
 medium_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "Out of all possible machines, our moderately sized airframes have been the most difficult to adapt with the advent of jet technology. Light aircraft have been rickety and larger machines have been difficult to design, but intermediate aeroplanes have proven to suffer dramatically in the development stage as a result of their wide range of use cases. All the same, the possibilities for payloads delivered from high altitudes and at incredible speeds make these aircraft a worthwhile investment."

Needless to say, something was expected to fill the technological gap and these large aircraft are the solution to that very problem. It took some convincing to have our pilots test many of the earlier iterations of these designs, but we have successfully created a number of functional heavy aircraft."
 large_plane_airframe_1: "Базовий великий авіакорпус"
 large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Our initial heavy airframe project was mediocre at best, spawning designs that had little in the way of survivability to deliver payloads with an explosive yield that made them only barely a worthwhile investment. New generations of fuselages and mounted weapons technology looks to drastically improve upon our original series of large aircraft with effective mountings for defence against enemy aircraft and an improved munitions capacity. Widespread use of metal in the hulls of these new aircraft will also decrease crew mortality rates considerably."
 large_plane_airframe_2: "Поліпшений великий авіакорпус"
 large_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "Now that the strategic bomber has proven its worth as a cost effective method of waging war, the next step is to further specialise their designs. Whilst the previous iterations of heavy aircraft were robust and their crews perished less frequently, they were far from perfect. With the design principles sound, our engineers can now focus on substantially improving the range of these aircraft with efficient arrangement of fuel tanks, creating yet more space for munitions in the process."
 large_plane_airframe_3: "Удосконалений великий авіакорпус"
 large_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "Building upon previous improvements to our designs, the next stage is to optimise the altitude which our largest airframes can reach. Smaller aircraft may have a speed advantage, but their size limits the lift their engines and wings can produce which makes altitude the best defence that our strategic bombers can leverage over other aircraft and ground defences alike. To many it would seem as though the development of aircraft this size is reaching its zenith, though that hasn't stopped our engineers from attempting further improvements."

 large_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "Thanks to the timely arrival of jet technology, the previously slowing development of large aircraft has once again begun to rapidly advance forward.

 ##BBA PLANES (techs)##
 early_bombs:0 "Aerial Bombs"
 early_bombs_desc:0 "Bombs dropped from planes isn't a novel idea, but it has previously consisted of the plane crew dropping petards over the side of their aircraft. Designing dedicated bombs with stabilisation fins and bomb locks and bays to deliver the ordinance are necessary steps for specialised "bomber" aircraft."
 photo_reconnaisance:0 "Aerial Photo Reconnaissance"
 photo_reconnaisance_desc:0 "Previously, most aerial reconnaissance was done personally by winged creatures such as griffons and pegasi flying high. This, however, required incredibly fit and well-trained scouts. Planes can fly considerably higher and mount specially designed high-quality cameras that can take detailed photos while being substantially more survivable."
 aa_lmg:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Machine Guns"
 aa_lmg_desc:0 "Early air-to-air combat in aircraft consisted of pilots using personal firearms to shoot at enemy combatants. Needless to say, new weapons have been devised both for primary and secondary armaments for aircraft. A good compromise between lethality and weight, rifle-calibre machine guns can serve that purpose."
 survivability_studies_desc:0 "Battle-damaged aircraft that return provide instrumental case studies for improving the survivability of our planes. We've found that pilots and the crew are vulnerable, as are our aircraft's fuel tanks and engines. We can add steel plating to protect the crew and the more vulnerable components and use self-sealing fuel tanks to prevent leaks from perforations."
 aircraft_construction:0 "Applied Wartime Construction Experience"
 aircraft_construction_desc:0 "All-metal fuselage construction has opened up new possibilities to improve aircraft designs and suit them in their dedicated combat roles. Some ideas have surged forward, such as dive brakes for dive bombers, floatation devices for floatplanes, or even turning airframes into flying boats for maritime use. New applied knowledge also allows us to use specially treated wood or fabrics where possible to save on valuable aluminium!"
 range_improvements:0 "Studies in Range Extension"
 range_improvements_desc:0 "The operational range of aircraft is primarily decided by its fuel capacity. Careful thought must be put into how fuel capacity can be increased. Of course, the natural option is to increase the number and size of the fuel tanks, but it's easier said than done without turning our aircraft into flying fire hazards. A somewhat simple, if inelegant, solution for smaller aircraft is a fuel drop tank that doesn't impede their flight characteristics."
 aa_hmg:0 "Heavy Machine Guns"
 aa_hmg_desc:0 "Newer all-metal planes, while not impervious to rifle-calibre weaponry, can prove difficult to down. Previous machine guns calibres simply don't do enough damage. This problem is more noticeable with larger aircrafts such as heavy fighters and bombers. As such, higher calibre machine guns that use larger cartridges are the natural evolution for most forms of primary and defensive armaments for aircraft."
 aa_cannon_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_1_desc:0 "Sometimes, machine guns are not enough. Their small cartridges cannot carry enough explosive mass. A forward-facing automatic cannon is, in essence, an upscaled machine gun. Though notably heavy enough to impact the agility of an aircraft, their damage output can make mincemeat of even armoured planes. In some cases, these cannons can even punch through tanks in strafing runs!"
 aa_cannon_2:0 "Large Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_2_desc:0 "Simply upsizing the cannons allows for ferocious firepower to be unleashed, though it does inhibit aerial performance in dogfighting."
 aa_cannon_3:0 "Improved Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_3_desc:0 "Further refinements in automatic cannons and the introduction of dedicated anti-aircraft ammunition belts have significantly improved their performance. This allows us to mount the new iterations of these cannons in turreted positions, providing a deadly deterrent against even determined attackers. Though their weight can still be problematic for smaller aircraft, the weapons more than compensate with their devastating firepower."

 engines_1:0 "Dedicated Aircraft Engines"
 engines_1_desc:0 "A powerful yet lightweight engine is essential to power a propeller's rotations enough to lift a heavier-than-air aircraft. The first generation of these "aero engines" are not dissimilar in shape to most concurrent engines in ground vehicles. There are many engine configuration, from simple piston engines to radial engines. However, great care has been taken to make these engines as robust as possible while keeping their weight low."
 engines_2:0 "Aircraft Inline Engines"
 engines_2_desc:0 "The term "inline engine" covers different configurations, all different from the radial configuration, with banks of cylinders instead of rows. Its most significant advantage is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimise drag and for a gun to be incorporated within the engine and the propeller in most configurations."
 engines_3:0 "Water-Injected Aircraft Engines"
 engines_3_desc:0 "Adding water increases the mass being accelerated out of combustion engines, increasing thrust and cooling. Since temperature is usually the limiting factor in engine performance at low altitudes, the cooling effect lets the engine run at higher rotations with more fuel injected and more thrust created without overheating. The cooling effects from water injection also enable greater compression ratios by reducing engine knocking."
 engines_4:0 "Turboprop Engines"
 engines_4_desc:0 "Turboprops share many components and principles with turbojet engines, except the exhaust gases do not provide enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller. This makes turboprops more fuel efficient and overall more reliable than jet engines. Its excellent power-to-weight ratio and reliability are enough to offset the high initial cost, maintenance, and fuel economy compared to regular piston engines."

 lmg_defense_turret: "Захисна турель із легким кулеметом"
 lmg_defense_turret_desc:0 "While somewhat underpowered for air-to-air combat, a light machine gun in a turret will make any attack against this plane a more dangerous undertaking."
 lmg_defense_turret_2x: "2 захисні турелі з легким кулеметом"
 lmg_defense_turret_2x_desc:0 "A set of two light machine guns in electrically-powered turrets cover more angles and make the plane a much harder target to attack."
 hmg_defense_turret: "Захисна турель із важким кулеметом"
 hmg_defense_turret_desc:0 "A heavy machine gun in a rotating turret allows the defender to fight back against a fighter armed with similar weapons with some hope of success."
 hmg_defense_turret_2x: "2 захисні турелі з важким кулеметом"
 hmg_defense_turret_2x_desc:0 "A set of two powered turrets with heavy machine guns present any attacking fighter with a dangerous target."
 cannon_defense_turret: "Захисна турель із гарматою"
 cannon_defense_turret_desc:0 "A modern cannon in a traversable turret significantly alters the balance of power between the defender and the attacker in air combat. Few fighters can withstand a direct hit from a modern cannon and continue to fight."
 cannon_defense_turret_2x: "2 захисні турелі з гарматою"
 cannon_defense_turret_2x_desc:0 "Two turrets armed with automatic cannons give the plane a fearsome defensive punch that would make any fighter attack on it a very dangerous prospect indeed."

 bomb_sights_1:0 "Early Tachometric Bombsight"
 bomb_sights_1_desc:0 "Bombsights are a relatively recent concept meant to help the bombardier accurately drop an aircraft's ordinance on target. However, even the more advanced visual sights, such as the course setting bomb sight, require quick vector calculations on the part of the bombardier and don't account for certain factors that affect the ballistics of bomb drops. With reliable mechanical calculators, tachometric bombsights can automatically calculate the proper aim point within moments when properly prepared."
 bomb_sights_2:0 "Improved Tachometric Bombsight"
 bomb_sights_2_desc:0 "Improved computers allow for more complex calculations and can also consider various external factors, such as wind speed and direction, air density, and even the oscillation of the aircraft, thanks to gyro-stabilisers. The newer generations of tachometric bombsights allow for more accurate and faster targeting solutions."

 radio_navigation_1:0 "Longwave Radio Detection Finder"
 radio_navigation_1_desc:0 "A radio receiver with loop antennas can be set to listen for the crossing of two radio-navigation beams. This makes radio detection finding (RDF) practical for aircraft and is helpful for long-range navigation thanks to the longwave signals."
 radio_navigation_2:0 "High-Frequency Direction Finder"
 radio_navigation_2_desc:0 "Issues with the reflections of high-frequency radio signals from the ionosphere pose a significant problem for navigation. However, with the addition of oscilloscopes and short-wave antennas, a navigator utilising this new RDF system can quickly locate radio signals accurately, allowing the detection of enemy short-form communications."

 air_ground_radar_1: "Радар «повітря–земля» I"
 air_ground_radar_1_desc:0 "Whilst the technology is very much in its infancy, this primitive selection of instruments can provide our air crews with a rudimentary targeting system. Though it eliminates some amount of luck in payload delivery and target acquisition, our pilots and bombardiers are still largely responsible for making sure they hit their marks."
 air_ground_radar_2: "Радар «повітря–земля» II"
 air_ground_radar_2_desc:0 "Having seen the promise in our original generation of airborne targeting equipment, it didn't take long for our engineers to improve and miniaturise much of the technology. The information provided by the system still requires confirmation from bombardiers thanks to the likelihood of faults, but these technological developments have nevertheless made dropping ordinance even more effective."

 air_air_radar_1: "Радар «повітря–повітря» I"
 air_air_radar_1_desc:0 "It wasn't long after the creation of radar that our engineers saw the potential in the same technology being used in our small aircraft. The thought process was that doing so would remove any given plane's reliance on a ground-based radar station, but the technology proved to be too cumbersome to mount on interception and air superiority aircraft. However, with recent miniaturisation efforts, it has now become possible to install such equipment; rudimentary as it may be."
 air_air_radar_2: "Радар «повітря–повітря» II"
 air_air_radar_2_desc:0 "Expectedly, the first batch of air-to-air radar installations were far from optimal. Though the pilots appreciated an extra piece of equipment to help locate enemy aircraft, ground based stations had both a longer range and less of an error margin compared to their airborne counterparts. In an effort to make the equipment more beneficial, the next generation of designs will have a greater range and will weigh even less so as to not be detrimental to the performance of our aircraft."
