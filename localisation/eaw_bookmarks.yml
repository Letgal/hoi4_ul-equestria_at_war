 #GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame." # moved to replace folder

 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Еквестрія жила в гармонії понад тисячу років під проводом принцеси Селестії. Держава нещодавно стикнулася з багатьма дрібними загрозами, але подолала ці труднощі з допомогою сили дружби та прощення. Однак обставини змінюються: вороги Еквестрії зібралися з силами й тепер стали серйозною загрозою. Миролюбна нація поні опинилася в новому світі з недругами на своїх границях, але також і серед самих себе. Як переживе Еквестрія тривожні часи попереду, і чи зможуть знову врятувати становище дружба та гармонія?"
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "П'ять років тому королева Кризаліс і її чейнджлінґи влаштували зухвале вторгнення з ціллю захопити Еквестрію та її столицю Кантерлот. На щастя для еквестрійців, закінчилося воно лихом. Ця поразка лиша посилила ненависть чейнджлінґів до поні. Скориставшися цим гнівом, Кризаліс успішно отримала майже всеосяжну підтримку своєї справи й об'єднала всі вулики під правлінням її одної. За її правління військо зазнало докорінного та стрімкого осучаснення з упровадженням сучасних озброєння, техніки та тактик. Настав час для нової війни, іцього разу чейнджлінґи можуть нарешті здобути остаточну перемогу над своїми ворогами." # (&)
 DED_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dread League has brought fear into the hearts of the Arcturian Order for hundreds of years, but few outside of it remember the existence of this far away realm filled with the living dead and the practitioners of the dark arts. The Dark Mages of Magehold have recently found some 'interesting' literature in the depth of the ancient fortress, and these became the center of a sort of... 'cultural rebirth' for the League.\n\nSoon, the World will remember the Dark Realm of the North. And soon, they will see its Truth."
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Радянська республіка Сталліонград, розміщена в еквестрійській північно-східній провінції Сєвєряна, тільки недавно відкололася від Еквестрії з надією утворити нове суспільство, в якому всі поні будуть рівні. На жаль, Сталліонград сьогодні далекий від свого засновного уявлення. Стрімка індустріалізація провалилася, а їжі бракує. Зважаючи на санкції з боку Еквестрії, загроза голоду дуже істотна. Правляча Комуністична партія, скута кризою керівництва, не здатна щось зробити. Сталліонград зможе вистояти супротив майбутньої бурі тільки після наступних виборів, коли партія вибере чіткого лідера." # (&?)

Воно давно була провідною торговельною силою у своєму регіоні, але віднедавна політична нестабільність і корупція спричинили купу проблем. Нижчі класи суспільства страждають найбільше, а неспокій шириться швидко. Ситуація лише погіршилася з приходом до влади короля Югана «Дьєвулена» — незаконного та вкрай корумпованого лідера. Поточна законна спадкоємиця престолу, королева Вельвет, розробила плани повернути трон, але для цього потрібна допомога. Чи допоможуть еквестрійці королеві в біді?

Імперія проявилася лише нещодавно, зарівно як і Сомбра, але врешті-решт Імперію звільнили з допомогою Еквестрії. Тепер, коли нею править еквестрійська принцеса, Мі Аморе Каденза, багато хто цікавиться, що зробить Кристальна Імперія в ці неспокійні часи. Чи залишаться кристальні поні вірними Еквестрії, або може до Імперії знову повернеться пітьма?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Горда раса яків завжди робила ставку на підтримці своїх традицій. Через це, їх ніколи надто не цікавила політика, хай вона зовнішня чи внутрішня. Однак, молодий принц Резерфорд нещодавно закінчив довгу ізоляцію яків і подружився з Еквестрією, що обурило яків сходу. Вони полишили Резерфорда й натомість підтримали його брата, принца Бредфорда. Тепер він веде бунтівний Йаки-клан і бажає взяти королівство собі. Розділені яки мусять об'єднатися, перш ніж стане запізно: на темному обрії формується хуртовина.

Їх очолює племінна рада, вождів для якої вибирають окремі племена, а ті, у свою чергу, вибирають очільника держави. Поточний вождь, Тандергувз, обачний і невпевнений щодо намірів поні. Його дочка-гармоністка Літтл Стронґгарт шукає тіснішу співпрацю, тим часом як давній Старійшина пам'ятає, коли бізони гасали всім південним заходом, і бажає повернення цих днів.

Однак після її поразки місто-держава, засноване на принципах абсолютної рівності, збилося з курсу. Старлайт таємно зберегла власну к'юті-марку, прибравши їх у інших. Коли Елементи Гармонії викрили її шахрайство, вона втекла й урешті-решт спокутувала свою провину.

Однак, через надмірну залежність Нова-Грифонії від імперських промислових товарів і військового захисту Імперії вона сильно постраждала в останні роки. Її армії складаються з ополчень, заледве втримуваних своїми командувачами, економіка фактично розвалилася і, на додачу до цього, велика кількість дисидентів, яких стара Імперія надіслала на ці береги, стали активнішими та жорстокішими, ніж будь-коли.

Однак країна далека від задоволення, адже її практично неіснуючий бюджет не здатен профінансувати свою індустрію, армію чи інфраструктуру. І тепер, як і в усі попередні роки, настав час губернаторові Маку відвідати Уетер, столицю Нова-Грифонії, та знову попросити кошти.

 GRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffonian Empire, once stretching across most of the continent, has long been known as "The sick Bird of Griffonia". Revolution and corruption took hold of the empire and its vast lands, breaking it apart one by one. Today, the Empire is left with nothing but a fraction of its territory, filled with dissatisfied nobles and commoners. The current Emperor, Grover V, is not expected to have long left until death claims his life. With his only heir to the throne being underage, the Empire is soon to face crisis once more. Will the Empire survive this new age? Or will internal conflict shatter it once and for all? Or perhaps the former glory of the Empire can be restored..."

The current establishment of Greifwald has ruled for long already, but the County is troubled by many problems. It's citizens are poor, it's army and industry greatly obsolete. And while the current regime tries it's best to keep everything stable, there exists a small but hardworking anarchistic party there, that could pose a great threat to the government.

 JER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Королівство Аквілея — одна з найстаріших держав грифонського континенту. Воно було й коли Імперія об'єдналася вперше, і воно одним із перших її покинуло. Але після того, що сталося, сама Аквілея пережила переворот і перетворилася на республіку. Але, так само як в Імперії, протривало це недовго. Однак республіка яскраво сяє в пам'яті грифонів — і це не єдина біда, з якою стикається Аквілея: відтоді, як Аквілея покинула Імперію, вона стала свого роду суперинком їй, і якщо Імперія колись спробує відживитися, Аквілея буде першою перешкодою на її шляху.

 GRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Prywhenian Liberation Army movement was born in the Kingdom of Brodfeld. Sparked by brutality of the king the revolutionary spirit of the griffons of Prywhen inspired an organisation of the resistance against the bourgeoisie. It managed to capture the popular support of peasants and workers throughout the country. For two years a devastating civil war is going on, more characterised by guerrilla warfare and raids than a full-scale war. But now the peasants and the proletariat have picked themselves up to make the final push into the royalists' nest of vipers. From there on, Prywhen will finally have a chance to decide their own destiny."
 MNC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Eriviar and his Sunstriker Bandits have ruled the Whitetail Mountains for years, becoming rich off raiding and pillaging their pony and griffon neighbours. Having become such an issue, the Emperor was forced to deal with them himself. The Emperor and Eriviar thus struck a pact in which the Bandits would receive weapons, griffonpower and funding from the former in exchange for swearing fealty to the Empire and keeping the Republicans and the Ponies busy. However, many political dissidents and opponents have used this opportunity and moved into Whitetail. A clash between these forces might be unavoidable."

Згуртувавшися навколо маршала Александра Кемерская, скоро республіканці взяли владу над Імперським Містом, однак після короткої та кривавої боротьби з прибічниками імператора новий республіканський режим був розбитий і вигнаний на північ, до колишнього герцогства Клаудбері. Хоч і обложена внутрішньопартійним конфліктом і безладом у сільській місцевості, спустошуваній воєначальниками, надія для республіки ще не втрачені.

 HLR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Arcturian Order is an ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of the Twelve Temples dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east. Ever since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job. Recent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The Twelve Temples believe themselves ready to weather the storm. The question is though, are they really ready for this?"
 BAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Blackrock Bandits are criminals and mercenaries that have formed together to ransack villages, pillage farms and rob unsuspecting enemies. At the top of the bandit food chain stands Blackrock herself. But not all is sunshine and flowers within the Bandit Queendom of Blackrock. To the east, there is a new communist power emerging in Prywhen. To the southwest, Wingbardy is gathering power and could strike towards Blackrock at a moment's notice. And if the Empire to the north ever manages to re-emerge as the great power it once was... then this might be the early death of the Blackrock Bandits. But bandits do not cry or shiver, for they fight on 'til the bitter end!"
 FAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ravaged by a devastating war that ended nearly two decades ago, Falcor lies in a precarious position nested between other great powers. The ruling Princess and her husband do their best to placate an angry populace, but the desire for revenge against the hated Wingbardians trumps all reason and logic. With meager resources and little potential allies, the griffons of Falcor will need to provide an exceptional effort if they wish to see their nation survive the looming storm."
 ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small Barony of Arantiga is home to a rich history. It was the birthplace of an ancient empire which stretched most of Griffonia. Led by Arantigos Featherin, the Arantigans ruled much of the world. However, the Empire collapsed and the Barony is all that's left. It has managed to weather the economic hardship of the Groverian Empire's collapse by tying itself to Wingbardy, but with the southern Kingdom now failing itself, Arantiga must decide if it should remain dependent on the south. Politically, some want to reform the barony into a normal state, based on ideology.

Grand Mayor Springtime Frost took power after his predecessor was assassinated by disgruntled army officers, yet another victim of the division that runs deep through Lakeish society. With the upcoming elections, the ponies of Lake City hope it will be a time for change, but there are those who see the elections as an opportunity to further their own goals."

 WIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An ancient Kingdom of unicorns and magic, Wittenland is proud of its meritocratic tradition, where the monarch is selected by a magical duel and not inheritance. Yet over the centuries the Kingdom stagnated and became a mere shadow of its former self, its mighty mage-nobles content to live in their mountain castles. But times are changing, and Wittenland must change as well. Everypony has different ideas on how exactly it should change, so the reigning Queen and reformer, White Star, must navigate the perilous intrigues of Wittenlandic politics if she hopes to save her nation from ruin."
 NIM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since ancient times, Nimbusia has been a democracy ruled by a pegasus warrior class. These stalwart ponies are some of the best trained soldiers in Griffonia, but require a large class of helots to produce for them. The democratic nation has reached turbulent time.

Some seek salvation from the King and the Gods that aid him while others hope for reforms that will turn the Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, yet both fight together against the Red Menace that seeks to undo all that they hold dear.

Created upon stolen pony territory by exiled socialists in the aftermath of the failed First Griffonian Revolution, the Socialist Republic must strive to maintain their hard-fought freedoms and liberties at home, whilst protecting the dream of a socialist Pan-Griffonia from the forces of reaction that surround and threaten the Republic on every front.

Something must be done soon, ere prized liberty is once again lost..."
 CYA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once loyal servants of the Empire, Cyanolisia is now stranded, its duty of keeping the minotaurs in check inside and outside their borders growing more difficult each day. The Countess is confident her loyal soldiers will not give up, even as conspiracy spreads among their ranks. Across the gulf, revanchist Asterion gears for war, and Cyanolisia must do everything it can to prepare."
 MIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion have grown tired of serving under despots and tyrants and have broken their shackles. Yet the Restoration War failed to claim the mainland, where hundreds of thousands of minotaurs still suffer.

Nevertheless they have managed to found a stable and prosperous nation, with solid democratic foundations.

No agreement has been made so far, and it must be done soon as elections slowly approach."

 STW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Strawberry Duchy is a place of wine and culture to much of the Griffonian elite, and its ruling family has long been second only to the Imperial lineage of the Grovers. It is the fiefdom of Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, and was one of the great champions of the empire during the revolution. Still, not all is well in the Duchy in these days. The Duchess has spent more and more time away from her fiefdom to be in Griffenheim, and some among her subjects wonder if she's forgotten about them. Maybe the time has come for Strawberry to assert itself beyond the duchess' reach? Or maybe dark clouds will gather and Strawberry once again will rise to be the bastion of loyalty it always has been?"
 ANG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Angriver, located in the vast Scheißwald Forest, has always been one of the poorest and most backward regions in the Empire. The dense forest provides refuge for monsters and bandits, as well as impeding development in the region. During the Revolution of 978, Baron Leer remained in control thanks to the support of Großmarschall Stoiber, but since then the two have grown distant, with Stoiber coming to disdain Leer's cruelty. Today, the Baron's grip over his land is threatened by Republican remnants, Anarchist rebels, and other shadowy conspirators. With so many groups straddling for power, Angriver's path forward is far from certain."
 PYT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The farmlands of Greifenmarschen were once ruled by a despotic Duke, who was overthrown by the local peasants. Because he had been Emperor Grover I's enemy, they were rewarded with autonomy as long as they remained loyal to the Empire. Thus the Peasants' Republic was born and has continued to exist to this day without much change. A direct democracy with elections every 3 months and referendums held on everything possible, it is highly democratic but also cumbersome. Yet so far, Greifenmarschen has had no need to rapidly change or adapt and has remained content in its rural paradise. That will soon change. Permanently."
 BRZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is said that the only beings the Emperor can trust are the diamond dogs of Bronzehill. In 792, Emperor Grover II granted the Bronze Mountains to a group of ex-slaves fleeing Diamond Mountain. Since then, the County of Bronzehill has grown and prospered as a loyal subject of the Empire. However, the collapse of the Empire and the republican uprisings of 978 have taken a toll on its economy, which finds itself more and more in the claws of foreign investors. Resulting tensions have led to more and more dogs questioning the absolute rule of the count. With the health of Grover V rapidly declining, the hounds of Bronzehill are anxious for what the future might hold."
 KAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Though situated nearly in the empire's backyard, Katerin is a place struggling to stay afloat in the modern era. What blessings they once had were undone by two great ills. First was the revolution of 978 that saw nearly all of the ruling von Katerinburg family killed as well as much of the city of Katerinburg destroyed, and second was the sole surviving heir to the throne, the crazed Diellza von Katerinburg, whose capricious and brutal reign has left the nation teetering on the brink. Will Katerin rise above its dark past, or will it be choked under the iron claw of its mad princess?"
 YAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yale is a nominal vassal of the Griffonian Empire. Having served as the academic centre of the Empire for generations, with Yale's Rectors eventually taking over the nation. However, as the Griffonian Empire declined over recent years, friction has emerged in the Yale Rectorate. Yale lacks a strong national identity and with the Emperor sicklier than ever, societal divides are deepening. The country's leader, Rector Mikusian, seeks to lead a moderate course, while revolutionary and reactionary universities try to mobilise the discontent in Yalish society for their own purposes. Will the light of Yale shine bright in the darkness, or will it be snuffed out like so many places of learning before it?"
 FEA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Troubling times have come to the Duchy of Feathisia. Currently ruled by Duke Gerlach IV, who brought about constitutional reforms and prosperity to the nation, disaster hit with the collapse of the great Griffonian Empire and the war that followed. The final blow was struck when Skyfall drove the Feathisian companies out of their markets, leaving the economy in shambles. With poverty rising throughout the country and confidence in the status quo at an all time low, radical socialist and nationalist groups have been gaining power in the turmoil. Can the situation be returned to normal, and Feathisia remain the nation it is? Or will drastic measures need to be taken?"
 ROU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The city of Romau has for the longest time been an area of political neutrality. As the last remaining Imperial Free City, Romau enjoys greater amounts of economic freedom and military protection than other vassals of the Griffonian Empire. This has caused the City to also become quite dependent on the Empire, however, and its political structure might not survive any further troubles in their main investor and protector. Dark times loom over the Empire, and its fate could very well become the fate of small, little Romau."
 TRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the Trade Federation of Skyfall, the wealthy dominate and pay little heed to the Empire, their former overlord. Its ruler, Iron Chancellor Guichard, has ruled the federation since its foundation, having driven out the Imperial garrison and seized the Imperial Navy. But Guichard is an old griffon, and it is clear he doesn't have much longer to live. The oligarchs see their chance to succeed him, the oppressed workers prepare of revolution, his young niece dreams of democracy, and in the shadows others conspire with the Archons of Griffenheim..."
 FEZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Like neighbouring Skyfall, Fezera is a prosperous trade port in western Griffonia and birthplace of the iconic Griffonian Fez. However, unlike its rich and famous neighbour, its choice of independence during the Griffonian Revolution didn't produce a golden age. Rather, the city decayed, mired in political turmoil and mobster activities from the penose with only the tireless Fezeraanse Politie preventing total chaos. But one griff rose to the occasion, the Skyfall-born Gwenaël Godard. Following a tumultuous election, he promised to restore Fezera to greatness. Of course, he has absolutely no ties to the smugglers and penose himself despite what some in the Politie claim."
 FLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small but immensely wealthy city of Flowena has managed to secure its independence from both Aquileia and the Empire. Rich bank-owning patricians rule the city with little regard to the common workers, choosing the mayor from amongst themselves. The current mayor, in fact, does very little ruling and a great amount of partying. But recently something has changed about him. He now has greater ambitions, and plans to reveal them to his fellow citizens soon..."
 AVI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Avian was once part of the much larger Duchy of Verenia. Its rule was relatively prosperous despite linguistic issues. However the Griffonian Revolution devastated Verenia, leaving many of its members dead and leading to a succession crisis between the House Eyrie and Erie branches of the Duchy. Lady Katrina Avian chose to stay out of the conflict and broke off with what is now known as House Avian. Unfournately this left the succession crisis in a stalemate and the linguistic divide only grew deeper. Will House Avian manage to unite the divided realm and survive through the upcoming storms? Or will it remain a footnote of history in the rise of some greater realm?"
 HAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haukland is one of the numerous splinter-states born out of the Griffonian Empire's collapse. Lead by the eccentric flying ace Hermann Meyer, it stands at the Crossroad between Griffonia and Equus and has become a hotbed of piracy, pirates with air-support no less. Despite his status as a warlord, Meyer rules the nation as a benevolent dictator, content to let people be as long as they don't interfere with his authority and allow him his antics. For years, he has let Haukland go with the flow, secure and thriving in its unique and rudimentary way but now, he seems bored with the status quo. And the Hauklandish know that Meyer is never as dangerous and unpredictable as when he is bored."
 LAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny island Barony of Rumare is considered by many to be a paradise rich with history, having avoided the devastation wrought by the collapse of the Empire. But the culture and language of the locals may soon become part of that history, becoming a fading memory as the Herzlander culture overtakes them. The new Baron, Alaric, a former mercenary who has returned to his home to succeed his late father, is determined to save his dying heritage before it is too late and restore his nation to its former glory. Rumare am byth!"
 NCR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "War. War never changes.\n\nA world untouched by the horrors that had befallen the Earth. A true paradise. That is what Equestria is to the NCR. The portal that links these two worlds was only recently discovered but the NCR was quick to seize upon securing this land. Now, the NCR Expedition is a prized jewel in a republic that spans two worlds. But their arrival isn't welcomed by all. Blood was spilt for this land and many strange new ideas come with the travelers through the gate."

 BAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Along the northeastern shore of Griffonia, the ponies of Bakara sail the seas, trading with their neighbours and collecting the ocean's bounty as they have for countless generations. Beyond taking pride in their mastery of the waves, Bakarans are proud of their ancestral homeland for being one of the oldest Republics in the world, standing as a beacon for democracy and justice. However, this year's upcoming election has become highly contentious, with the campaign already having seen unprecedented levels of political violence. Will Bakara stay on its course, or is it time to break from the past and forge a new order for the Riverlands?"
 BAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The cursed land of Barrad is ruled over by Ambrosius, a pony fattened by decadence and luxury, but who tired of such conventional extravagance and turned to dark magic to sate his curiosity. After a horrific and inexplicable cataclysm ravaged Barrad, there were none able to challenge the rule of the self-proclaimed Count Ambrosius, and now the Mad Count torments his subjects for his own entertainment, aided by four ambitious travelers tempted by his offers of power and forbidden knowledge. Together they form the Pentarchy, and they conduct their research and experimentation with no ethical strings attached."
 OLV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Austurland lies in the eastern reaches of Griffonia, and holds the distinction of being the only deer majority country on the continent. A land of berserkers and Vikings, Austurland has remained at an effectively feudal state for centuries. But such a situation cannot last forever, and dire reform is needed if Austurland hopes to become anything more than a rump state on the edges of the continent. The ascension of the new Jarl, Ygritte, has brought an opportunity for reform, but her personality and background remain a mystery."
 ZES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born out of a slave revolt, the Kása Free State has existed on the shores of southeastern Griffonia for nearly a century. Ready to defend their hard-won liberty hoof and tooth, Kása has stood as a haven for Wittenlandic serfs, Austurlandic thralls and Gryphussian indentured servants alike. With its venerable leader, Mansu Erba, growing old, the question has risen of who will take charge of this sanctuary state when she no longer is there for it. Can the beacon of freedom keep shining, or will it be extinguished in the darkness of the coming age?"

 FRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The County of Francistria has always found itself between two spheres of influence, those of Aquileia and Wingbardy. Founded by a member of the Discret dynasty, the nation has nevertheless formed close ties with the Karthinian Pact. After the fall of the Empire, Francistria took advantage of the alliance and the Aquileian revolution to seize Tarrin, a land they had claimed for a long time. But after the Falcor War everything went downhill. The Count died and his heir became a puppet of the nobility, Wingbardy is in crisis and Tarrinians resist the occupation fiercely. Can the small nation survive these dark times, or will it be swallowed up by greater powers?"
 TAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since time immemorial, the Talousians have been safeguarded by their mountains, which have kept out countless invaders and foreign influences. When Wingbardy seceded, Talouse was quick to join them, and the Karthinian Pact seemed to promise endless prosperity. However, the Falcor War, and its fallout, shattered that belief. The economy, once one of the most prosperous in Griffonia, is now in a seemingly endless decline, and the population grows more radical by the day, as both the socialists and the Fetivolists clamor for their attention. As the situation grows ever more out of control, will Talouse manage to come out of hiding and face the world, or will it perish from its cowardice?"

 HIP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Гіпогрифія — це домівка гіпогрифів і морських поні. Це – гармонійна абсолютна монархія, яка досі відновлюється від років ізоляції під морськими хвилями. Королева Ново захистила свою країну під час Війни Шторма, однак дехто вважає, що вона могла би зробити набагато більше, щоби зупинити спустошення з боку Короля Шторма. Але навіть поки королівський двір вагається в питанні мінливого світу та врівноважує вимоги міжнародної дипломатії й ізоляціоністів у себе, сюди проникають нові ідеї. Республіканізм і навіть комунізм переживають зліт, і ще належить побачити, як відповість королеа. Чи збереже Гіпогрифія курс гармонії, чи прийме екстремальні ідеї лівих, а може впаде в реакцію, щоби уникнути їх?" # (&)
 TBK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Tobuck is a city more than it is a state, a tiny piece of territory taken away from the Zarantian tribes by the Storm King during his reign of terror. Gun runners, opportunists and the warlords on their payroll have taken over the scrap of land in his absence, making the city and its surroundings a haven for the most deplorable of creatures. It is a prize seemingly open for the taking as much as it is a place of opportunity all on its own; that is, so long as whoever takes control can keep the young nation alive..."
 BAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the failure of Nightmare Moon's initial rebellion, many of her supporters fled Equestria, seeking a place to rebuild and rearm in secret. Now, the lands of Zebrica play host to Chiropterra, an ultra-militaristic slaver state that seeks to bring about Her return. Through worship of The Nightmare and the possibility for generations of slaves to achieve full citizenship, they have augmented their numbers and promoted fierce doctrine of might and belief. Given the decades the Imperial Legions have had to plan and prepare, their swift assistance to the Nightmare is assured if she should rise, but will their aid be enough in bringing Her to power?" #Mara
 #MGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Maregypt has an ancient history stretching back many millennia: Its Old Kingdom reached glorious heights and built grand monuments, but eventually fractured, falling to Saddle Arabian conquerors in 567 and languishing for centuries under foreign rule. After gaining independence in 987, Maregypt prospered; but the good times were cut short when the Storm King invaded, pillaging the land and leaving countless ponies starving and disillusioned. However, it was during this bleak time that Somnambula—Maregypt's great heroine of legend—was freed from Limbo after centuries of absence. Her miraculous return has given ponies fresh hope for the future, but how long will that hope last?"
 ZAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Zarantia is a new player on the world stage, having been born only fifty years ago after the Imazeeb tribes liberated the city of Tobuck. This state was meant to be a union between Ponies and Zebras, a compromise between the strength and security provided by unity and the ability to preserve their traditions. These ambitions, however, were badly wounded after the rampage of the Storm King and the fall of Tobuck to foreign criminals. The tribes have retreated to their old lands, and there they now prepare for the day they can reunite with their pony sisters and brothers. If it happens peacefully they will rejoice. If they must reclaim it with force they will not hesitate."
 CTH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mighty Colthage, a great nation rocked until recently by the assault of the Storm King, weathered the great trial. Now Zalathel Zarca has been elected to lead the nation to glory, having been duly appointed by the Senate despite claims of tampering, corruption and rigging the election. He seeks to rebuild the country in order to reclaim its ancient glory of ages past. However, a number of powerful factions are on the rise, and seek to carve their own claim to power. Others wish to nullify the corruption of Zalathel's rule, and restore things to the older days of the Republic, whilst some in the east cry out for land reform and increased autonomy. Can Zalathel persevere, or will Colthage collapse under the strain?" #Mara
 CTL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The heirs of the ancient Viking Sea-Kings, the Olenians of Chital now face a threat to their cultural and political hegemony greater than any Southern revolt or religious awakening: the dissent of their own Yaril. Benjen V, newly coronated following the death of his brother and father, formed the Council of Seven to assuage concerns of open revolt from Chital's native Hindians, but the council now stands on the edge of open revolt itself. Southern schemers, firebrand reformists, and an aging bureaucracy all grapple for the Kind Viking's approval, all the while extremists of Northern and Southern stripes plot his demise. Can Benjen and his council survive, or will they fall like the Deerlaw before them?"
 WAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nestled away in the western fringes of Zonicia, the kingdom of Warzena has persevered for millennia. However, recent events have shaken the kingdom to its core. The Storm King's invasion has devastated the nation, robbing it of its riches and its king, leaving his brother to pick up the pieces. Meanwhile, anti-monarchist elements are making their move to overthrow the ancient regime and deliver the country into the light of the present, while threats mount on the nation's borders. Will the king manage to hold on to his crown, or will his enemies finally wrestle control of the nation from the clutches of the past?"
 HEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Twenty years after the revolution of outlaws, partisans, and Old Believers that liberated Adelart from the yoke of the Greifwaldians and their Aquileian overlords, Adelart and its green glades once again stand at the precipice of subjugation. Beset by internal strife and haunted by the impending return of its former sheriff, hardened in his own twenty years of exile, the fractured coalition of zealots, believers, idealists, and merry griffs must become something more than just a bandit confederation held together by sheer force of will... or convince their citizens fraternity transcends all boundaries after all."
 PLB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the northern shores of Equus, the polar bears have recently banded together into a modern civilization. Paw Wellington, a mighty warrior who brought the clans together, will soon be entering his fifth year of rule. His position, however, is not certain, and the clans still chafe under his rule. But with the Changelings to the southwest, they may need to learn to cooperate. Can the bears hold on and avoid being conquered by their ancient foes?"
 KIR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A century ago, the Silence was decreed to save Kiria from the chaos and strife of modern civilisation. Today, the Silence has been lifted, and the Realm emerges from its self-imposed isolation into a world even more dangerous and unstable, fraught with hostile ideologies, predatory empires, and war. To realise her dream of an open and prosperous Kiria, idealistic Premier Autumn Blaze must use all her skill and wits to lead her kirin out of the dark past and through the turbulent present. The Realm must stand united against the centrifugal forces unleashed by the unbridled dash for national modernisation. Fail, and the ensuing Cacophony will make the kirin yearn for the quiet of a new Silence."
 ABY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia is the old home of the Abyssinian race, talking and sapient cats who stand upright. It prospered for almost a century after the Clawomonic Restoration, managing to partially industrialize thanks to Wingbardian aid. But like in many other places in Zebrica, the Storm King's invasion devastated the country. Now, its King is too melancholic to rule effectively, relations with Wingbardy have become strained, claimants to the throne plot in the shadows and the slaves are getting restless. Abyssinia survived the first millenium, but will it survive the second one?"
