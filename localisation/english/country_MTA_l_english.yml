Вивчення магії як наукової дисципліни — їхня спеціалізація, а їхнє завдання — захист потужних магічних артефактів. Їхні команди шукачів, складені з потужних тренованих магів, які можуть наодинці зрівнятися з цілими взводами, обшукують увесь світ у пошуках нових артефактів і зберігають їх у Печері, де можуть залишатися в надійних копитах цілу вічність."

 #MTA_Tireless_Tracker_desc:0 "§YBiography§!: Though he was born in Equestria, Tireless Tracker had spent the majority of his life in and around the forests of Greifwald. A treasure hunter by heart, he sought to delve into areas not often explored by others; most of Equestria had its fair share of adventurers, after all. Though Greifwald had no mystical forests like the Everfree, Tireless became attached to the area for the fundamental beauty of the otherwise mundane woodlands.\n\nAfter many years of collecting various knick-knacks and moderately valuable treasures, he stumbled upon a few strange artifacts that perplexed him and everyone he showed them to, something that drew the attention of a Retrieval Team that happened to be in the area. After a brief conversation, a senior agent concluded that Tireless could be of use to The Council. The agent contacted their superiors, and then Tireless was inducted into the ranks of their organization.\n\nDespite being an Earth Pony, Tireless Tracker showed exemplary talent when it came to finding obscure artifacts. This talent extended to other areas as well, as showcased during a crucial Class-3 Retrieval Mission. The team that Tireless was accompanying were ambushed and left lost and injured within hostile territory. They were forced to hole up in an abandoned house while they waited for an opportunity to escape. It was then that Tireless pointed out and corrected several flaws in their defense plans that, at the time, seemed counterintuitive to the agents he was with. Due to his actions, the entire team was able to return to headquarters safely with the artifact secured.\n\nThat mission brought him under the attention of the Obsidian Council, who decided that his skills might be better utilized in a leadership position over their task forces. Since then, Tireless Tracker has led several successful operations with minimal casualties.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
