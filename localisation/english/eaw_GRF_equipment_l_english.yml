 GRF_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The appearance of new armored fighting vehicles implemented by first by the Severyanian revolutionaries in 995 deeply interested the Nova Griffonian high command. Due to economic stagnation and military budget cuts it was impossible to start designing a tank from scratch - despite the rising tensions on Equus in the first years of the 2nd millennium. Military officials managed to acquire a prototype through backchannel negotiations with the Changeling government. M1 'Likhttraktor' is a significant modification of its changeling counterpart - featuring a redesigned hull interior and a brand new turret capable of fitting a griffon commander."

 GRF_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The long-awaited awakening from the economic stagnation in 1007 finally allowed Nova Griffonia to focus on its first completely indigenous tank designs. Designed by the first dedicated AFV designing concern - Ironwheel Motoris - the M4 relied on the feedback gathered during field tests of its predecessor - the Likhttraktor. Just as before emphasis was put on crew ergonomics and flexibility to operate in tough logistical conditions always present across the vast lands of Nova Griffonia. Tests were also performed with special anti-tank machine gun ammunition intended to give the vehicle some capability in tank-to-tank combat - at least at short range."
