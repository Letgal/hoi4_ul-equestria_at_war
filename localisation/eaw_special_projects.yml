What makes this particular project interesting is the application of unique low-energy magic that can be used to interpret and subsequently scramble coded messages using spells only known to select individuals.

  sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles_desc:0 "Although crystals typically carry a somewhat containable amount of energy which requires considerable effort to release, it seems as though it is possible - particularly with large crystals - to force additional energy inside them. The more energy contained, the more fragile the crystal and the greater propensity it has for detonating spectacularly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some bright minds had the genius idea of turning these concerningly volatile crystals into projectile weapons that detonate shortly after impacting a surface like a HEAT or HESH shell."

To make some headway in rectifying this, scientists have proposed that a correctly enchanted radio headset and microphone could allow our kind to properly communicate regardless of their native language.

The alloy - so named for its presence in meteorites and coveted for both its strength and rarity - was long thought to be impossible to create in a worldly environment for many years, but this appears to have been a false assumption. Thanks in no small part to recent thaumaturgical advancements, it is theorised that we may be able to reproduce the vacuous conditions of space that could enable the production of starmetal on an unprecedented scale."

The ability to move in three dimensions through the water has alleviated the strain this restriction would otherwise put on city infrastructure, but it is clear that some kind of mass transit will be needed in the near future.

  sp_grand_astrological_orrery_desc: "Astrology has long been employed by kirin to interpret the signs of the stars and the seasons, so it stands to reason that we would pursue the construction of a grand orrery with which to perform even more detailed predictions of the future. It will - of course - utilise the relevant and most up-to-date star charts, numerological and probability calculations in order to maximise the accuracy and utility of whatever answers we may find to our many burning questions."

  sp_camo_cloak_desc:0 "Creating a substance that has the capacity to visually adapt to its surroundings will be no easy task, but it is a concept worth pursuing. We have always enjoyed the ability to change visually into most creatures and objects at will, yet our equipment does not enjoy the same kind of instant visual protection. Moreover, even talented changelings cannot mimic things beyond or below certain sizes. If our scientists could identify the biological magic that allows us to visually camouflage ourselves and isolate it, subsequently applying the same magic to cloaks and tarpaulins could radically alter the way we utilise stealth on a tactical level."

  sp_temporary_chitin_structures_desc:0 "Changeling hives are not alive, but have often been described as such due to how reactive they can be to changeling magic, with tunnels closing and opening at a drone's will. Much of this is due to the chitin and mucal material biologically produced and used by changelings to construct hives and maintain their function and integrity. A recent proposal suggested that we experiment on this material through thaumaturgical genetic modification, potentially allowing a few changelings to establish a small hive quickly. This structure can then be used as a temporary forward operating base until it begins to deteriorate after a few weeks. This could provide our soldiers with a home away from home and a local love repository that will improve their morale and fighting capabilities for a short time."

Using angry spirits as a tool of chaos against enemy formations is not a new strategy on its own, but using unicorn-inspired telekinetics to trap them inside grenade-sized containers certainly is. With such a device our forces could sow chaos anytime and anywhere, not to mention that being trapped in such a way would further infuriate the vengeful spirit contained within before they are set upon our enemies."

Instead it has been theorised that we can apply their visions to a grander strategy, collecting as many seers as possible in one place and collating the information provided in order to formulate a pinpoint plan for the future.

Some engineers want the suit users to perform better by slimming down on the suit's weight and permitting more wing movement to increase their flight speed. Many want to add armour plates instead to offer better protection and pockets to carry extra equipment for an assault.

##### TAG SPECIFIC #######
 sp_future_infantry_rifle:0 "Project SALVO"
 sp_future_infantry_rifle_desc:0 "One of Terrafin's dearest desires is to see every infantrygriff carrying a weapon of the future. This has already manifested in the use of magical weaponry, but we must go further. Imagine recoil-dampening spells, weapons firing three times as fast as traditional rifles, guns that fire small explosive charges to effectively shoot around corners! Although the venerable slugthrower will be very hard to improve on, our scientists are surely up to the task."
 sp_land_reward_future_infantry_rifle_focus_preference:0 "Caseless or Flechettes?"
 sp_land_reward_future_infantry_rifle_focus_preference_desc:0 "We need to lock in our preferred type of rifle. Two proposals are before us.

 sp_land_reward_option_flechette:0 "Flechettes have enormous potential."
 sp_future_tank:0 "Project SHATTER"
 sp_future_tank_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are obviously the future of armored warfare, but current heavies simply aren't powerful enough and run into problems with their transmissions and engines. A true super-heavy tank, not merely an upscaled heavy but a tank designed to kill them, will provide a powerful front-line advantage over heavy tanks and comfortable superiority against anything lighter.\n\nTo be properly useful, of course, it will have to be amphibious as well."
 sp_land_reward_future_tank_preference:0 "Conventional or Amphibious?"
 sp_land_reward_future_tank_preference_desc:0 "Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."
 sp_land_reward_option_conventional:0 "Go with Terrafin's idea and abandon the amphibious requirement."
 sp_land_reward_option_amphibious:0 "We believe in our scientists! They can do it!"

 sp_ground_effect_vehicle:0 "Project TIDALWAVE"
 sp_ground_effect_vehicle_desc:0 "Planes flying low over the water have reported a curious increase to their lift, dubbed the "ground effect". This may make possible larger plane/boat hybrids, capable of moving extremely fast and avoiding enemy RADAR by simply flying under it. Ideally such plane/boats would be able to hold missiles or torpedoes. Therefore, these "ground effect vehicles" must be investigated as soon as possible."
 sp_nuclear_naval_mines:0 "Project BARNACLE"
 sp_nuclear_naval_mines_desc:0 "While it may seem insane to leave nuclear weapons floating around in the ocean, the fact is that a single naval mine, if equipped with a nuclear payload, can sink entire flotillas of enemy vessels, and can effectively deny a much larger area to the enemy since enemy vessels those far away from the blast could be damaged or sunk."
 sp_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"
 sp_nuclear_depth_charges_desc:0 "Our current depth charges are effective, but due to their limited blast radius they often fail to disable their targets, particularly if the submarine detects the charge and changes depth before it goes off. The Exotic Weaponry Commission has come up with a solution to that problem which some are calling overkill: arming our depth charges with low-yield nuclear bombs, to kill every submarine in the area regardless of changing depth."
 sp_nuclear_air_to_air_rocket:0 "Project FALLOUT"
 sp_nuclear_air_to_air_rocket_desc:0 "A single strategic bomber can rightfully be called a "Flying Fortress," and an entire formation of them is extremely difficult for our fighters to engage. Project FALLOUT would see some of our fighters armed with unguided air-to-air rockets tipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead: the massive blast wave would turn enemy bomber's formations against them, downing an entire wing in a single fireball."
 sp_nuclear_land_mines:0 "Project TATZLWURM"
 sp_nuclear_land_mines_desc:0 "Our pioneer corps could benefit from the recent explosion of new uses for nuclear technology. If we could engineer a safe, reliable demolition charge with a nuclear payload, it would make collapsing large buildings and clearing out the biggest minefields so much easier. They could also serve quite well as area-denial weapons."
 sp_nuclear_rocket_artillery:0 "Project TANKBUSTER"
 sp_nuclear_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "Project TANKBUSTER aims to produce the smallest nuclear weapon yet: one capable of being fired out of a conventional rocket artillery system. The idea of equipping even our ground forces with nuclear weapons is tantalizing, although Terrafin is quick to point out the logistical and strategic limitations of such an endeavour. Still, if the project is successful its value in destroying armoured formations, area denial, attacking fortifications, and sheer Shock and Awe cannot be overstated."
 sp_personal_grenade_launcher:0 "Project BOMBTHROWER"
 sp_personal_grenade_launcher_desc:0 "An interesting request has come to us from below, from a commissar in an infantry battalion. She has raised issues with the range of rifle grenades, and has suggested a "personal grenade launcher", to be carried by one creature per platoon. More portable than a mortar, it would allow easy response to enemy situations and hefty firepower in a small package."
 sp_future_bomber:0 "Project STARFIRE"
 sp_future_bomber_desc:0 "Traditional bombers remain highly vulnerable to fighters and interceptors. To counter this threat and truly become a global power, we will have to design something radically different. Flying far faster and higher than traditional bombers, our Valkyrie will be virtually invulnerable to conventional AA as well as interceptors. While this may necessitate some compromises in other parts of the design, it will surely prove worthwhile once completed."


 HIP_sp_nuclear_torpedos_desc:0 "One obvious naval application of nuclear weapons is in torpedoes. A torpedo tipped with a nuclear warhead, even a low-yield one, could effortlessly sink even the heaviest warships. With our recent advances in nuclear technology, this formidable new weapon may finally be in reach."
 HIP_sp_air_helicopter:0 "Project SHOOTING STAR"
 HIP_sp_air_helicopter_desc:0 "Airplanes in the night sky are a powerful asset for the Air Force, but they're not enough. Rotary aircraft have the potential to totally change the nature of air-land battle. We must jump-start the helicopter age and gain supremacy over the supremacists of the world."
 HIP_sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile:0 "Project STANDOFF"
 HIP_sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile_desc:0 "The potential of air-launched cruise missiles to strike enemy silos and airbases cannot be overstated.
